# Milestone #2: Interim Project Demo

* Worth 10% of grade\.  Due June 27 in class\.  This is a group activity with individual responsibilities\.
* For this deliverable\, you will demonstrate the working capabilities of your project to date\.  Each team member must demonstrate the capabilities that they have worked on\.
* You do not have to demonstrate an integrated solution \(if you have one\, that's fine\, but it is not required\)\.
* Requirements
  * Demo length must be a maximum of 10 minutes\.  Repeat: You must complete your demo in 10 minutes\.  I recommend doing at least one practice run together beforehand to ensure that your team is able to give a timely demo\.
    * Plan out who is presenting in what order
    * Plan out whether one person will "drive" a single running code demo while they and others talk\, or whether you will switch screens/computers\.
  * Team must be prepared to demonstrate when they are asked to start\.
    * Have all code loaded and running beforehand\.
    * Do not try to make last minute changes and then waste class time waiting for it to build and run\.
    * Each teammate should have what they are going to demonstrate ready to go before they start the demo\.
    * You should not be trying to "switch" git branches during the demo \- that will slow things down too much and will be penalized\.
    * A normal\, few seconds switching screen share from one teammate to another will not be an issue\.  Wasting a lot of time handing off from one person to another will be penalized\.
    * Highly recommend having a particular git commit saved and well labelled \(e\.g\.\, milestone 2 demo version\) when you practice your demo and then don't make any more changes to the code\!  If you do make changes\, be ready to go back to your saved commit\.
  * You should indicate in your demo any significant changes in design that may have occurred since your design document\.  This may be done verbally\, with a visual aid or by showing what you actually did instead in the product itself\.
  * You should indicate in your demo any significant issues encountered and how you addressed them\.  This may be done verbally\.  Don't spend too much time on this and run overtime\!
  * You do not have to provide a separate presentation \(i\.e\.\, slides\)\, but you may do so if it you wish\.  You will still have only 10 minutes total though\.

* Each team member must present a meaningful percentage of the demo\.
  * If one person dominates the presentation\, this will be penalized
  * Be polite and explicit when handing off speaking role to another teammate\.
  * If a teammate seems to be having difficulty or getting confused/flustered\, support them but do not "take over"\.
* If you have completed a task that does not yet have end\-to\-end capability\, find a way to demonstrate what you have completed \(e\.g\.\, run a script that shows database functionality\, show a UI component with hard\-coded data\, show how actions in UI result in changes in database\, etc\.\)
* __Self\-Report: __ Along with the demo\, each team member must submit \(on Lea\) a rating of the contribution for Milestone 2 for themselves and each team member on a scale of 1 to 10\.  For each member\, including yourself\, please give a short sentence or two describing their effort\.  This should capture their effort in coding the work as well as for helping prepare and give the demo\.
  * E\.g\.\,
    * Me: 7\.5 \- Got a little behind and Jane had to take on one of my coding tasks\.  I helped prepare for the demo and participated in the practice run\.
    * Jane: 10 \- She really helped get us set up in git and completed all her tasks\, and one of mine\, on time\.  Helped prepare for the demo and tried to keep us all on track\.
    * Joe: 5 \- He fell behind and did not get all his coding tasks done as planned for the demo\, but did complete one key task and helped me with one issue I had\.  Missed the practice demo run and didn't contribute much to the demo planning\.
  * Details should be given on any lack of or poor participation so that undue reward is not given\.  In such cases\, provide details\.  Ideally\, bring such issues to my attention as early as possible so they can be addressed\.
  * Each teammate must submit a private report on Lea and it must include a mark\+description for themselves and all teammates\.
* Marking Scheme:
  * 25% Timeliness and professional conduct of demonstration
  * 30% Coding progress made
  * 25% Quality of demonstration
  * 20% Individual contributions \(Will be based on self\-reports and teacher assessment\)
    * Note: Low participation will result in penalties for that individual on other marking categories as appropriate based on their actual contributions\.
