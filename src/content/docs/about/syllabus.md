From the [course outline](/about/course-outline): 

> This course covers the process of software development, consisting of the proposal, design, implementation, documentation, and deployment of a software project. Students will learn the skills necessary to create a mobile application using the Android framework in Kotlin.

This course continues on Application Development I, with a few twists. Rather than developing in a language and for a platform that we are all familiar with, we will **practise learning new programming paradigms in a new language**, for the purpose of **creating applications that cohere with modern development best practises**. We will do this by engaging with open source projects right from the beginning of this course, and learning how they are constructed in order to make similar applications ourselves.

After this course, you should feel more confident approaching developing a new project in ANY programming language, for ANY platform, by employing the best practises for a specific language and target platform to a higher level.

On top of that, you should have your own [Android application][sample-apps] deployed on GitHub as a testament to what you learned.
