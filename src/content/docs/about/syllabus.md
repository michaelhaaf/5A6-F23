## Learning outcomes

### Technologies
- How to program in a new language: [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
- How to develop [multiplatform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-platform_software) applications using [Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/multiplatform)
- How to create user interfaces for multiplatform applications: [Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) 

### Principles
- How to use appropriate design principles, tools and techniques to produce robust mobile code
- How to work together in groups to design and create a multiplatform app
- How to develop critical thinking, exploratory learning-by-doing, and collaborative learning skills
- How to make and assess design decisions
- How to build something that is useful, usable, and effective

## Motivation

_Helping others be productive_

How could you help make their life easier? What kinds of assistance could you provide? What tools could help with keeping organized, performing tasks, staying on top of things, etc\.?

_Helping others connect?_

How would they meet each other? What type of activities would they be involved in? How would they communicate with each other? How could you help them collaborate better?

_Running a business?_

How would you attract customers? What information and services would you provide? How would you maintain the interest of your customers? How would you make money?

_Having fun?_

What kind of entertainment could you provide? How would they interact and stay interested? How would they be able to choose or influence what happens?

_Keeping others informed?_

How would you get the information they need? How would you display the information so it is easy to understand quickly? How would they explore that information?

_What is the purpose, how is it relevant to the end user, and how do you ensure it is appealing and works well?_

## Class Format

Important to learn on your own too\! Look up things you’re not sure about, explore concepts introduced in class, and try to find out more about techniques discussed in class\.

- Introduce new concepts/techniques
  - Expectation: Cameras on while teaching new content so I can detect quickly when people are confused or having issues\.
  - I will poll for progress/issues using the Teams “Raise Hand” feature
- Walk\-through code examples and/or Try It\! Exercises
  - Walkthroughs: Students code along on your systems too while I share my screen
  - Try It\!: Short coding exercise on your own \(e\.g\., 5 – 10 min\)
  - Expectation: Cameras optional for walkthroughs/Try It\! \(Teacher too\)\.
  - I will ask for submission of your exercise content – Important that you do all activities and keep up\. Class is too fast\-paced\!
- Lab Exercises
  - Larger exercises to complete individually \(Some worth marks as indicated\)
- We will use all classtime\. If you finish an activity earlier than the rest of the class, then…
  - Work on making your solution more elaborate/creative and try new things out\.
  - Research more details about technique online \(often some links will be provided\)
  - Work on the assignment/project
  - Or, help a friend – you can learn a lot by teaching
- Collaborative sessions
  - Work together in groups in meeting rooms on group assignments/project
- Test / Review sessions
- _30 minute break \(no work assigned during break\) plus short breaks to move around as needed \(~1 to 1\.5 hours apart\)\._

### Semester goals

- Month 1: Build a simple single\-screen app in Kotlin with a UI
  - Android or iOS
  - Exercises: Learn Kotlin, get completely setup & with git, initial app
  - Assignment 1: Basic App
  - Project: Form Teams & Determine type of app
- Month 2: Build a multi\-screen app that connects to a database
  - Android & iOS
  - Exercises: Navigate, Connect to database, Integrated App
  - Assignment 2: Multi\-screen App
  - Milestone 1: Design Document & Design Presentation
- Month 3: Build an app with error handling, user authentication, 3rd party api, and good UI layout
  - Android & iOS
  - Self\-guided exercises, Test prep & Test
  - Milestone 2: Preliminary demo
- Month 4: Complete project & demo in Android & iOS
  - Final project: Final demo

### Tools required for this course

- Teams \- For classes and for communication \(time\-critical\) outside of class
  - We'll use screen share to show your work
  - Class slides will be posted to Teams\. Sometimes beforehand, always after\.
- MIO \- For communicating \(non\-time\-critical\)
- Email \- For communicating \(time\-critical\)\.  Will aim for <24hr response\.
- Lea \- For receiving & submitting exercises/assignments/project and getting marks
- Google Forms – For test
- Android Studio
  - We use this for development and debugging\.
- Github – For maintaining and sharing codebase
- Online document share \(e\.g\., Google Docs\) for shared project documentation

### On using AI, Stack Overflow, etc.

- There are lots of cool tools and resources out there to help us as programmers\.
- Recently, AI tools are in focus\. Here, for example, we have autocomplete/code generation tools in our IDEs\. ChatGPT and other such tools are also available\.
- Bottom\-line – you're here to learn\. You learn by doing things yourself, not by having them done for you or told to you\. It is best to think of these tools as aids for speeding up doing what you already know\.
- So, for example, if you find yourself looking for an autocomplete suggestion or code generation in order to figure out what you're supposed to do… stop yourself\.
  - save yourself typing \- ok
  - save yourself thinking – not ok
- As for other resources online or getting help from someone else, they are all great for researching solutions for how to do things\. But, in the end, you need to be able to do it yourself\.
  - Don't: Borrow solutions you don't understand\.
  - Don't: Copy lots of code and expect it to all work out\.
  - Do: If you get an idea or suggestions from a source \(including another person\), put a reference to it in your comments
  - Do: If you do happen to copy a portion of code exactly, put a clear indication of what isn't yours in the comments  otherwise cheating/plagiarism \(which = mark of 0 and reported to college\)\.
  - You don't have to give a source for my code provided in class/slides\. But, if I or another student help you figure out how to do something complex, always nice to given a shout out in the comments\.
