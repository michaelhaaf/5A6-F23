Worth 2%

Visit the following two web pages. Read the pages in detail and try out each code example in an IDE. Play around with it a bit to get a sense of how coroutines and flows work.

- [https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-basics.html](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-basics.html)
- [https://kotlinlang.org/docs/flow.html##flows-are-cold](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/flow.html#flows-are-cold)

Then, complete as much of these two codelabs as possible during remaining classtime.

- [https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-coroutines-android-studio](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-coroutines-android-studio)
  - Don't do step 7 (unit tests)
- [https://developer.android.com/codelabs/jetpack-compose-advanced-state-side-effects](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/jetpack-compose-advanced-state-side-effects)
- Please note: This has Android-specific approaches in it that are not fully aligned with Multiplatform.
