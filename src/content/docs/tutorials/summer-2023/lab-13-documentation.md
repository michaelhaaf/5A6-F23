In this exercise, you will explore about documentation and practice documenting your code

## 1. The Good, The Bad, The Ugly

Spend 10 minutes looking through packages available at pub.dev.

Examine the documentation made available in the code, readme or more (website, etc.).

Find examples of documentation that you find very well done and useful – "The Good". Take a couple screenshots.

Find examples of documentation that you find done poorly or vacuously – "The Bad". Take a couple screenshots.

Find examples of documentation that you find done very badly or even misleading – "The Ugly". Take a couple screenshots.

## 2. Document-First

Write a class that will perform math, string or array operations of your choosing.

- It should have at least 2 methods – one "simple" and one "more complex"

Think about the class for a few minutes and design it in your head or on paper.

Now, create a new file and write some initial class documentation summarizing that class

- Take a screenshot showing your documentation before you code

Start coding the class

For each method, write the documentation first.

- Take a couple screenshots showing your documentation before and after you code each method.

## 3. Add Docs

Look over some of the key classes in your project so far.

Are they good, bad or ugly when it comes to documentation?

- Hands-Up For Ugly…
- Hands-Up For Bad…
- Hands-Up for Good…

Pick one that isn't "good" and make it so.

- Optional: Leverage an IDE documentation helper if you can find one.

Screenshare your (newly updated) "Good"!

Capture some screenshots of your "Good"

Zip up all screenshots and upload to Lea.
