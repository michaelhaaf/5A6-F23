*These notes have been adapted from [Compose layout basics](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/layouts/basics).*

It may seem counter-intuitive to create a user interface out of functions, rather than out of tags like you are used to with markup languages like HTML. Where are the components rendered on a screen? How can we control the "flow" of the interface?

This lecture focuses on the **layout** of `@Composable` functions, explaining some of the building blocks Compose provides to help you lay out your UI elements.

## Basics of Composable layouts

[Review from last lecture](/5A6-F23/lectures/user-interfaces/01-introduction-to-compose): `@Composable` functions are the basic building block of Compose. A composable function is a function emitting `Unit` that describes some part of your UI. The function takes some input and generates what's shown on the screen. 

A single `@Composable` function can emit several UI elements. In the `ArtistCard` function below, two `Text` elements are generated:

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Kotlin">

  ```kotlin
  @Composable
  fun ArtistCard() {
    Text("Alfred Sisley")
    Text("3 minutes ago")
  }
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Result">

  ![The text content of two text elements overlapped upon eachother, making both illegible.](./img/layout-stack.png)

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip[Note]
For this example, and most others, click the "Result" tab to see an approximate `@Preview` of the UI rendered by Compose for the given "Kotlin" code.
:::

Compose does not handle layout automatically, and may arrange the elements in a way you don't like. In the above example, Compose stacks the text elements on top of eachother, making them unreadable.

The reason this happens is that the `ArtistCard()` function has the instruction to draw two Text elements, but does NOT have instructions about the **location** those elements should be drawn.

Compose comes built-in with a variety of [layout components](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/foundation/layout/package-summary) that we can use. We can then *compose* these elements to define our own layouts.

### Column, Row, and Box

Application user interfaces are (mostly) two dimensional, and made up of "boxes". The easiest way to fix the `ArtistCard()`, then, is to arrange these "boxes" in either a [`Column`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/foundation/layout/package-summary#Column(androidx.compose.ui.Modifier,androidx.compose.foundation.layout.Arrangement.Vertical,androidx.compose.ui.Alignment.Horizontal,kotlin.Function1)) or a [`Row`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/foundation/layout/package-summary#Row(androidx.compose.ui.Modifier,androidx.compose.foundation.layout.Arrangement.Horizontal,androidx.compose.ui.Alignment.Vertical,kotlin.Function1)), which are happily built-in for us:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Kotlin">

  ```kotlin
  @Composable
  fun ArtistCardColumn() {
      Column {
          Text("Alfred Sisley")
          Text("3 minutes ago")
      }
  }
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Result">

  ![The text content of two text elements arranged vertically using the Column element](./img/layout-text-in-column.png)

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

While using the `Row` element alone would unravel the stack, it's not as interesting to place two text elements side-by-side. Instead, we can [nest]() `@Composable` layout elements to produce more complicated layouts, such as a `Column` within a `Row`:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Kotlin">

  ```kotlin
  @Composable
  fun ArtistCardRow(artist: Artist) {
      Row(verticalAlignment = Alignment.CenterVertically) {
          Image(bitmap = artist.image, contentDescription = "Artist image")
          Column {
              Text(artist.name)
              Text(artist.lastSeenOnline)
          }
      }
  }
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Result">

  ![The text content remains in a column, but that column is now in a row next to an image.](./img/layout-text-with-picture.png)

  *Note: this example, and many following examples, make use of the [`Image`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/foundation/package-summary#Image(androidx.compose.ui.graphics.painter.Painter,kotlin.String,androidx.compose.ui.Modifier,androidx.compose.ui.Alignment,androidx.compose.ui.layout.ContentScale,kotlin.Float,androidx.compose.ui.graphics.ColorFilter)) builtin `@Composable`. Like other `@Composable` elements, `Image` returns a Kotlin `Unit` and takes an optional `Modifier` parameter, as well a non-optional [`Painter`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/ui/graphics/painter/Painter#Painter()) which specifies *what* image/thing to draw in the `Image` element. See [Working with Images](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/graphics/images) for more information and examples.*

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Finally, the [`Box`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/foundation/layout/package-summary#Box(androidx.compose.ui.Modifier,androidx.compose.ui.Alignment,kotlin.Boolean,kotlin.Function1)) element allows you to control how elements are stacked upon eachother, allowing you to create stacks of elements where overlap is desired:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Kotlin">

  ```kotlin
  @Composable
  fun ArtistAvatar(artist: Artist) {
      Box {
          Image(bitmap = artist.image, contentDescription = "Artist image")
          Icon(Icons.Filled.Check, contentDescription = "Check mark")
      }
  }
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Result">

  ![An icon overlayed on top of an Image](./img/layout-box-with-picture.png)

  *Note: In this result, the "Artist Image" seems to be centered, while the "Check mark" `Icon` seems to be bottom-right aligned. I'm not really sure if the example code I've provided will have this exact behavior, I didn't try it myself. The [next section](alignment-and-arragnment) makes alignment customizations more clear.*

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The primary layout components `Column`, `Row`, and `Box` are expressive and powerful in combination, and are often all you need to create complex layouts. You can write your own composable function to combine these layouts into a more elaborate layout that suits your app.

### Alignment and Arrangement

So far, it appears as though Jetpack Compose centers elements horizontally and vertically within their containers. This is pretty nice default behavior, but it would be nicer if we could control it -- so of course, we can. We can see some useful parameters for this by taking a look at the definitions for each of `Row`, `Column`, and `Box`:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Row">

  ```kotlin {4-5} title="Kotlin"
  @Composable
  inline fun Row(
      modifier: Modifier = Modifier,
      horizontalArrangement: Arrangement.Horizontal = Arrangement.Start,
      verticalAlignment: Alignment.Vertical = Alignment.Top,
      content: @Composable RowScope.() -> Unit
  ): Unit
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Column">

  ```kotlin {4-5} title="Kotlin"
  @Composable
  inline fun Column(
      modifier: Modifier = Modifier,
      verticalArrangement: Arrangement.Vertical = Arrangement.Top,
      horizontalAlignment: Alignment.Horizontal = Alignment.Start,
      content: @Composable ColumnScope.() -> Unit
  ): Unit
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Box">

  ```kotlin {4} title="Kotlin"
  @Composable
  inline fun Box(
      modifier: Modifier = Modifier,
      contentAlignment: Alignment = Alignment.TopStart,
      propagateMinConstraints: Boolean = false,
      content: @Composable BoxScope.() -> Unit
  ): Unit
  ```

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

To set children's position within a `Row`, set the `horizontalArrangement` and `verticalAlignment` arguments. For a `Column`, set the `verticalArrangement` and `horizontalAlignment` arguments. 

:::tip
You can think of the `Row` and `Column` components, and their `arrangment` and `alignment` parameters, as being similar to setting the [flex direction](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-direction) for [Flexboxes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox) in CSS.

That is, the **primary axis** of `Row` elements is horizontal, and you **arrange** (space between, space evenly, etc.) elements along that axis while **aligning** (top, bottom, center, etc.) elements on the vertical axis.

Similarly, the **primary axis** of `Column` elements is vertical, and you **arrange** elements along that axis while **aligning** elements on the horizontal axis.

There isn't really a similar analogy for `Box` elements -- these take just an `alignment` parameter and no `arrangement`.
:::

Below follow some of the possible arguments for each, and their effects.

### The layout model

*These notes have been adapted from [Custom layouts in Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/layouts/custom).*

As we have seen, UI elements in Compose are represented by the `@Composable` functions that emit a piece of UI when invoked. Since composables are functions, each composable can call other composable functions within their function body, allowing us to define nested UI structres. Behind the scenes, these composable UI elements are added to a UI tree that gets rendered on the screen. How is this "tree" modeled?

Each UI element has **one parent** and **zero to many children**. Each element is also located *within its parent*, specified as an `(x, y)` position, and a size, specified as a `width` and a `height`.

That is, **parent elements define the constraints for their child elements**, while **child elements take up the space made available to them by their parent**. 

Constraints restrict the minimum and maximum `width` and `height` of an element. If an element has child elements, it may measure each child to help determine its own size (and may even expand to make more room, if that parent has room to expand). Once an element determines and reports its own size, it defines how to place its child elements relative to itself.

Laying out each node in the UI tree is therefore a three step process. Each node must:
  - Measure any children
  - Decide its own size
  - Place its children

Since UI is a tree structure, an initial render of the UI recursively performs this three-step process on all nodes. Afterwards, nodes are [lazily recomposed](/5A6-F23/lectures/user-interfaces/01-introduction-to-compose) whenever there are UI changes, ensuring that only nodes which require updates are rerendered.

We'll see in the [Layout modifiers](#layout-modifiers) section how you can use the layout model to customize these behaviors in Compose.

## Modifiers

*These notes have been adapted from [Compose modifiers](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/modifiers) and [API Guidelines for Jetpack Compose](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/support/+/androidx-main/compose/docs/compose-api-guidelines.md#elements-accept-and-respect-a-modifier-parameter).*

Modifiers allow you to **decorate** or **augment** a composable. Modifiers let you do these sorts of things:

- Change the composable's size, layout, behavior, and appearance
- Add information, like accessibility labels
- Process user input
- Add high-level interactions, like making an element clickable, scrollable, draggable, or zoomable

Modifiers are standard [Kotlin objects](/5A6-F23/lectures/programming/02-oop-in-kotlin). Create a modifier by calling one of the [`Modifier`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/ui/Modifier) class functions:

```kotlin {3} title="Kotlin"
@Composable
private fun Greeting(name: String) {
    Column(modifier = Modifier.padding(24.dp)) {
        Text(text = "Hello,")
        Text(text = name)
    }
}
```

`Modifier` functions are factory [extension functions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/extensions.html) on `Modifier`, (that is, each of these extention functions returns a modified Modifer) allowing us to **chain** `Modifier` function class for combined effects:


<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Kotlin">

  ```kotlin {4-6}
  @Composable
  private fun Greeting(name: String) {
    Column(
      modifier = Modifier
                  .padding(24.dp),
                  .fillMaxWidth()
    ) {
        Text(text = "Hello,")
        Text(text = name)
      }
  }
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Result">

  ![The column element with modified padding and maxWidth](./img/modifier-chained.png)

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

In the code above, notice different modifier functions used together.

  - `padding` puts space around an element.
  - `fillMaxWidth` makes the composable fill the maximum width given to it from its parent.

**All the `@Composables` your write should accept an optional `modifier` parameter**, and **pass that modifier to its first child that emits UI**. Doing so makes your code more reusable and makes its behavior more predictable and intuitive:

```kotlin {5, 8} title="(Kotlin)"
@Composable
fun FancyButton(
    text: String,
    onClick: () -> Unit,
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier // Optional parameter (has a default argument)
) = Text(
    text = text,
    modifier = modifier.surface(elevation = 4.dp) // modifier passed to child (with customizations)
        .clickable(onClick)
        .padding(horizontal = 32.dp, vertical = 16.dp)
)
```

Modifiers are the standard means of adding external behavior and customizations to an element in Compose. Through the `Modifier` parameter, we don't have to worry about defining common behavior/customizations for each `@Composable` we create. This allows element APIs to be *smaller and more focused*, as `Modifiers` are used to decorate those elements with standard behavior.

A best practise is for the `Modifier` to occupy the **first optional parameter slot** in a `@Composable`. This sets a consistent expectation for developers: they can always provide a modifier as the **final positional parameter** to an element call for any given element's common case.

For more information, see the Compose API guidelines, [Elements accept and respect a Modifier parameter](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/support/+/androidx-main/compose/docs/compose-api-guidelines.md#elements-accept-and-respect-a-modifier-parameter).

### Modifier chain order matters

The order of modifier functions in a chain of calls is significant. Since each function makes changes to the `Modifier` returned by the previous function, **the sequence order affects the final result**. Let's see an example of this:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Kotlin">

  ```kotlin
  @Composable
  fun ArtistCard(/*...*/) {
      val padding = 16.dp
      Column(
          Modifier
              .clickable(onClick = onClick)
              .padding(padding)
              .fillMaxWidth()
      ) {
          // rest of the implementation
      }
  }
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Result">

  ![A clickable, padded, max-width artist card (in that order). The padded area is clickable.](./img/layout-padding-clickable.gif)

  *Note: the "padding" here is the small white band that encompasses the entire `@Composable` (above the title, below the image, etc.)*
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

In the code above the whole area is clickable, including the surrounding padding, because the `padding` modifier has been applied *after* the `clickable` modifier. If the modifiers order is reversed, the space added by padding does not react to user input:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Kotlin">

  ```kotlin {6-7}
  @Composable
  fun ArtistCard(/*...*/) {
      val padding = 16.dp
      Column(
          Modifier
              .padding(padding)
              .clickable(onClick = onClick)
              .fillMaxWidth()
      ) {
          // rest of the implementation
      }
  }
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Result">

  ![A padded, clickable, max-width artist card (in that order). The padded area is not clickable.](./img/layout-padding-not-clickable.gif)

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The explicit ordering of `Modifier` chains helps developers create predictable and controllable outcomes from a variety of `Modifier` combinations.

:::tip[Note]
The modifier design makes differing behavior "outside" and "inside" an element explicit and predictable. It also explains why there is not a `margin` modifier but only a `padding` one, since changing the order of modifications can produce both results.
:::

## Built-in modifiers

Jetpack Compose provides a list of built-in modifiers to help you decorate or augment a composable. Here are some common modifiers you'll use to adjust your layouts.

### padding & size

By default, layouts provided in Compose wrap their children. However, you can set a size by using the size modifier:

```kotlin title="Kotlin"
@Composable
fun ArtistCard(/*...*/) {
    Row(
        modifier = Modifier.size(width = 400.dp, height = 100.dp)
    ) {
        Image(/*...*/)
        Column { /*...*/ }
    }
}
```

Note that the size you specified might not be respected if it does not satisfy the constraints coming from the layout's parent (see [the layout model](#the-layout-model). If you require the composable size to be fixed regardless of the incoming constraints, use the `requiredSize` modifier:

```kotlin {8} title="Kotlin"
@Composable
fun ArtistCard(/*...*/) {
    Row(
        modifier = Modifier.size(width = 400.dp, height = 100.dp)
    ) {
        Image(
            /*...*/
            modifier = Modifier.requiredSize(150.dp)
        )
        Column { /*...*/ }
    }
}
```

In this example, even with the parent `height` set to `100.dp`, the `height` of the `Image` will be `150.dp`, as the `requiredSize` modifier takes precedence.

:::tip[Note]
When a child element does not respect the size constraints set by its parent, the layout system will hide this from the parent. The parent will see the child's `width` and `height` values as if they were coerced in the constraints provided by the parent. The layout system will then center the child within the space allocated by the parent under the assumption that the child respected the constraints. Developers can override this centering behaviour by applying `wrapContentSize` modifiers to the child.
:::

If you want a child layout to fill all the available height allowed by the parent, add the `fillMaxHeight` modifier (Compose also provides `fillMaxSize` and `fillMaxWidth`):

```kotlin {8} title="Kotlin"
@Composable
fun ArtistCard(/*...*/) {
    Row(
        modifier = Modifier.size(width = 400.dp, height = 100.dp)
    ) {
        Image(
            /*...*/
            modifier = Modifier.fillMaxHeight()
        )
        Column { /*...*/ }
    }
}
```

To add padding all around an element, set a `padding` modifier.

If you want to add padding above a text baseline such that you achieve a specific distance from the top of the layout to the baseline, use the `paddingFromBaseline` modifier:

```kotlin {7} title="Kotlin"
@Composable
fun ArtistCard(artist: Artist) {
    Row(/*...*/) {
        Column {
            Text(
                text = artist.name,
                modifier = Modifier.paddingFromBaseline(top = 50.dp)
            )
            Text(artist.lastSeenOnline)
        }
    }
}
```

### Offset

To position a layout *relative* to its original position, add the `offset` modifier and set the offset in the x and y axis. Offsets can be positive as well as non-positive. The difference between `padding` and `offset` is that adding an `offset` to a composable does not change its measurements:

```kotlin {8} title="Kotlin"
@Composable
fun ArtistCard(artist: Artist) {
    Row(/*...*/) {
        Column {
            Text(artist.name)
            Text(
                text = artist.lastSeenOnline,
                modifier = Modifier.offset(x = 4.dp)
            )
        }
    }
}
```

The `offset` modifier is applied horizontally according to the layout direction -- by default, shifting an element to the right; but shifting an element to the left in a [right-to-left]() context (see link for more detail). 

### layout modifiers

See ["Use the layout modifier"](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/layouts/custom) on the Developer Android docs. (notes to be updated soon.)

## Scope safety in Compose

In Compose, there are modifiers that can only be used when applied to children of certain composables. Compose enforces this by means of custom scopes.

For example, if you want to make a child as big as the parent `Box` without affecting the `Box` size, use the [`matchParentSize`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/foundation/layout/BoxScope#(androidx.compose.ui.Modifier).matchParentSize()) modifier. `matchParentSize` is only available in [`BoxScope`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/foundation/layout/BoxScope). Therefore, it can only be used on a child within a `Box` parent.

### `matchParentSize` in `Box`

As mentioned above, if you want a child layout to be the same size as a parent `Box` without affecting the `Box` size, use the `matchParentSize` modifier.

Note that `matchParentSize` is only available within a `Box` scope, meaning that it only applies to direct children of `Box` composables.

In the example below, the child `Spacer` takes its size from its parent `Box`, which in turn takes its size from the biggest children, `ArtistCard` in this case.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Kotlin">

  ```kotlin {5}
  fun MatchParentSizeComposable() {
      Box {
          Spacer(
              Modifier
                  .matchParentSize() // .fillMaxSize()
                  .background(Color.LightGray)
          )
          ArtistCard()
      }
  }
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="matchParentSize">

  ![Gray background filling its container](./img/layout-matchparentsize-new.png)

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="fillMaxSize">

  ![Gray background filling the screen](./img/layout-fillmaxsize.png)

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


### `weight` in `Row` and `Column`

As you have seen in the previous section, by default, a composable size is defined by the content it is wrapping (i.e. by the size of its children). You can set a composable size to be flexible within its parent using the `weight` Modifier that is only available in `RowScope` and `ColumnScope`.

Let’s take a `Row` that contains two `Box` composables. The first box is given twice the `weight` of the second, so it's given twice the width. Since the `Row` is 210.dp wide, the first `Box` is `140.dp` wide, and the second is `70.dp`:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Kotlin">

  ```kotlin {8, 11}
  @Composable
  fun ArtistCard(/*...*/) {
    Row(
      modifier = Modifier.fillMaxWidth()
    ) {
        Image(
            /*...*/
            modifier = Modifier.weight(2f)
        )
        Column(
            modifier = Modifier.weight(1f)
        ) {
            /*...*/
        }
    }
  }
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Result">

  ![The image width is twice the text width](./img/layout-weight.png)

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip[Note]
The `weight` property is pretty similar to the [`flex`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex) property in CSS Flexbox (that is -- you can set the proportion a child element takes of a parent flexbox's space using this property).
:::

## Reusing modifiers

Multiple modifiers can be chained together to decorate or augment a composable. This chain is created via the [`Modifier`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/ui/Modifier) interface which represents an ordered, immutable list of single [`Modifier.Elements`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/ui/Modifier.Element)

Create your own Modifier chains and extract them to reuse them on multiple composable components. It is completely fine to just save a modifier, as they are data-like objects:

```kotlin title="Kotlin"
val reusableModifier = Modifier
    .fillMaxWidth()
    .background(Color.Red)
    .padding(12.dp)
```

Each `Modifier.Element` represents an individual behavior, like layout, drawing and graphics behaviors, all gesture-related, focus and semantics behaviors, as well as device input events. Their ordering matters: modifier elements that are added first will be applied first.

Sometimes it can be beneficial to reuse the same modifier chain instances in multiple composables, by extracting them into variables and hoisting them into higher scopes. It can improve code readability or help improve your app's performance for a few reasons:

  - The re-allocation of the modifiers won’t be repeated when recomposition occurs for composables that use them
  - Modifier chains could potentially be very long and complex, so reusing the same instance of a chain can alleviate the workload Compose runtime needs to do when comparing them
  - This extraction promotes code cleanliness, consistency and maintainability across the codebase
