You can find more information about ViewModel, StateFlow, and Side Effects in Jetpack Compose apps from the following resources.

Note that Coroutines are also an important subject to understand: I have recently updated supplementary lectures explaining the basics of Coroutines and Flows in Kotlin (see the [Kotlin coroutine lecture notes](/5A6-F23/lectures/programming/05-coroutines)).
