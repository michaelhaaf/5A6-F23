### Lifecycle of Composables

* Compose has 3 main phases
  * Composition: What UI to show. Compose runs composable functions and creates a description of your UI.
  * Layout: Where to place UI. This phase consists of two steps: measurement and placement. Layout elements measure and place themselves and any child elements in 2D coordinates, for each node in the layout tree.
  * Drawing: How it renders. UI elements draw into a Canvas, usually a device screen.
* Unidirectional Data Flow: Order of these phases is generally the same, allowing data to flow in one direction from composition to layout to drawing.
