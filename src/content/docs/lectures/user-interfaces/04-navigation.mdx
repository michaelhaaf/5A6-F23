Navigation refers to the interactions that let users navigate across, into, and back out from the different pieces of content within your app.

Android Jetpack's Navigation component helps you implement navigation, from simple button clicks to more complex patterns, such as app bars and the navigation drawer.

The Navigation component also ensures a consistent and predictable user experience by adhering to an established [set of principles](#navigation-principles).

## Navigation key parts

The Navigation component consists of three key parts, which are described below:

  - Navigation graph: An XML resource that contains all navigation-related information in one centralized location. This includes all the individual content areas within your app, called destinations, as well as the possible paths that a user can take through your app.
  - `NavHost`: An empty container that displays destinations from your navigation graph. The Navigation component contains a default `NavHost` implementation, [`NavHostFragment`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/navigation/fragment/NavHostFragment), that displays fragment destinations.
  - `NavController`: An object that manages app navigation within a `NavHost`. The `NavController` orchestrates the swapping of destination content in the `NavHost` as users move throughout your app.

As you navigate through your app, you tell the NavController that you want to navigate either along a specific path in your navigation graph or directly to a specific destination. The NavController then shows the appropriate destination in the NavHost.

The Navigation component provides a number of other benefits, including the following:

    Handling fragment transactions.
    Handling Up and Back actions correctly by default.
    Providing standardized resources for animations and transitions.
    Implementing and handling deep linking.
    Including Navigation UI patterns, such as navigation drawers and bottom navigation, with minimal additional work.
    Including Safe Args, a Gradle plugin that provides type safety when navigating and passing data between destinations.
    Providing ViewModel support—you can scope a ViewModel to a navigation graph to share UI-related data between the graph's destinations.

In addition, you can use Android Studio's Navigation Editor to view and edit your navigation graphs.

## Navigation Principles

*These notes have been adapted from [Navigation Principles](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/principles).*

Navigation between different screens and apps is a core part of the user experience. The following principles set a baseline for a consistent and intuitive user experience across apps. The [Navigation component](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/navigation) is designed to implement these principles by default, ensuring that users can apply the same heuristics and patterns in navigation as they move between apps.

### Fixed start destination

Every app you build has a fixed start destination. This is the first screen the user sees when they launch your app from the launcher. This destination is also the last screen the user sees when they return to the launcher after pressing the Back button. Let’s take a look at the [Sunflower app](https://github.com/android/sunflower/tree/main/app) as an example.

![The Sunflower app has a particular screen fixed as its start destination.](./img/nav-01.png)

**Figure 1.** The List Screen is the Sunflower app's start destination.

When launching the Sunflower app from the launcher, the first screen that a user sees is the List Screen, the list of plants in their garden. This is also the last screen they see before exiting the app. If they press the Back button from the list screen, they navigate back to the launcher.

### Navigation state is represented as a stack of destinations

When your app is first launched, a new task is created for the user, and app displays its start destination. This becomes the base destination of what is known as the back stack and is the basis for your app’s navigation state. The top of the stack is the current screen, and the previous destinations in the stack represent the history of where you've been. The back stack always has the start destination of the app at the bottom of the stack.

Operations that change the back stack always operate on the top of the stack, either by pushing a new destination onto the top of the stack or popping the top-most destination off the stack. Navigating to a destination pushes that destination on top of the stack.

The Navigation component manages all of your back stack ordering for you, though you can also choose to manage the back stack yourself.

### Up and Back are identical within your app's task

![The up and back buttons are left-facing arrows in Android](./img/navigation-up-back.png)

**Figure 2.** The Up and Back buttons

The Back button appears in the system navigation bar at the bottom of the screen and is used to navigate in reverse-chronological order through the history of screens the user has recently worked with. When you press the Back button, the current destination is popped off the top of the back stack, and you then navigate to the previous destination.

The Up button appears in the app bar at the top of the screen. Within your app's task, the Up and Back buttons behave identically.

### The Up button never exits your app

If a user is at the app's start destination, then the Up button does not appear, because the Up button never exits the app. The Back button, however, is shown and does exit the app.

When your app is launched using a deep link on another app's task, Up transitions users back to your app’s task and through a simulated back stack and not to the app that triggered the deep link. The Back button, however, does take you back to the other app.

### Deep linking simulates manual navigation

Whether deep linking or manually navigating to a specific destination, you can use the Up button to navigate through destinations back to the start destination.

When deep linking to a destination within your app’s task, any existing back stack for your app’s task is removed and replaced with the deep-linked back stack.

Using the Sunflower app again as an example, let’s assume that the user had previously launched the app from the launcher screen and navigated to the detail screen for an apple. Looking at the Recents screen would indicate that a task exists with the top most screen being the detail screen for the Apple.

![The screens visited in an app produce a "back stack" allowing clear disambiguation for which screen to go "back" to in history.](./img/navigation-principles-deep-linking.png)

**Figure 3.** User navigation through the Sunflower app and the resulting back stack.

At this point, the user can tap the Home button to put the app in the background. Next, let’s say this app has a deep link feature that allows users to launch directly into a specific plant detail screen by name. Opening the app via this deep link completely replaces the current Sunflower back stack shown in figure 3 with a new back stack, as shown in figure 4:

![Back stacks are regenerated when a deep link is clicked](./img/navigation-principles-deep-linking-2.png)

**Figure 4.** Following a deep link replaces the existing back stack for the Sunflower app.

Notice that the Sunflower back stack is replaced by a synthetic back stack with the avocado detail screen at the top. The My Garden screen, which is the start destination, was also added to the back stack. The original Sunflower back stack is gone, including the app's knowledge that the user was on the Apple details screen before. All of this is important because the synthetic back stack must be realistic. It should match a back stack that could have been achieved by organically navigating through the app.

To meet this need, the synthetic back stack that is created is a simplified one based on the NavGraph. For a simple NavGraph without nesting, this will consist of the start destination and the deep link destination. For more complex, nested navigation graphs, the synthetic back stack will also contain the start destinations of any nested graphs that are ancestors of the deep link destination.

The Navigation component supports deep linking and recreates a realistic back stack for you when linking to any destination in your navigation graph.
