These lecture notes are contained in powerpoint slides, which can be downloaded below:

- [Slide set 1](/5A6-F23/slides/AppDevProcess.pdf): The software development process
- [Slide set 2](/5A6-F23/slides/RequiremensEngineering.pdf): Requirements engineering and creating user stories

## Key Points

- Understand the **specification, development, validation, and evolution** of software
- Understand how "Agile Development" interleaves these distinct processes (i.e. how are requirements engineering and design/implementation treated in Agile development)
- Understand the relationship between **User Stories, Requirements, Releases, and Scenarios**
- Understand the difference between functional and non-functional requirements

In your project milestone, you will be turning project requirements into a set of User Stories that are documented on GitHub. The slides above give specifications for what those stories and requirements should accomplish and what properties they should have.
