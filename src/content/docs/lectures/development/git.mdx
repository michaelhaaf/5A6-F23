One of the is distinguishing between **content** and **style** changes. You should adhere to the following rules:
  - Commits that change code style DO NOT change code behavior
  - Commits that change code behavior DO NOT change code style
  - Commits that refactor code DO NOT change code behavior

Your commits in general (even on development branches) should be **atomic**, that is:

> An **atomic commit** is a commit that includes changes related to only one feature or task of your program. There are two main reasons for doing this: first, if something you change turns out to cause some problems, it is easy to revert the specific change without losing other changes; and second, it enables you to write better commit messages. ([The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-git-basics))

Adhering to these requirements will force you to practise good habits in choosing the changes you include in each commit carefully and practising `git` techniques for amending/resetting/cleaning locals commits before pushing to a shared repository. These are *incredibly* important skills in both industry and open-source development -- your pull requests will not be accepted until you learn how to do them!

:::tip[Note]
Branch protection rules are described above, [GitHub rulesets](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-rulesets/about-rulesets) are an **alternative** to branch protection rules that are more customizable. They should not be necessary for this stage of the project, but you may use them instead of following the instructions above if you wish.
