## What is Git?

*These notes were adapted from https://microsoft.github.io/code-with-engineering-playbook/source-control/git-guidance/*

Git is a **distributed version control system**. Every participant has a local copy of the source-code, and the attached history that is kept in sync by comparing commit **hashes** ([SHA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Hash_Algorithm) hashes of changes between each git commit command) making up the latest version (called `HEAD`).

```bash
repo 1: A -> B -> C -> D -> HEAD
repo 2: A -> B -> HEAD
repo 3: X -> Y -> Z -> HEAD
repo 4: A -> J -> HEAD
```

Since they share a common history, repo 1 and repo 2 can be synchronized
fairly easily, repo 4 *may* be able to synchronize as well, but it\'s
going to have to add a commit (J, and maybe a merge commit) to repo 1.
Repo 3 cannot be easily synchronized with the others. Everything related
to these commits is stored in a local .git directory in the root of the
repository.

In other words, **by using Git you are simply creating immutable file
histories that uniquely identify the current state and therefore allow
sharing whatever comes after**.

## Basic workflow

A basic Git workflow is as follows. 

```bash
# pull the latest changes
git pull

# start a new feature branch based on the "develop" branch
git checkout -b feature/123-add-git-instructions develop

# another way to do the same thing:
git switch -c feature/123-add-git-instructions develop

# edit some files

# add and commit the files
git add <file>
git commit -m "add basic instructions"

# edit some files

# add and commit the files
git add <file>
git commit

# "git commit" will cause your $EDITOR will appear -- this is an environment variable that can be changed. Common CLI options are `nano`, `vim`, and `emacs`. In a git GUI, a built-in editor will appear at this point.
# This allows you to write multi-line commit messages, which is important for large changes.

# check your changes
# 'git status' may be the git command I use most
git status

# by default, `git diff` shows the line-by-line additions/removals/changes to all unstaged changes in your repository
git diff

# push the branch to the remote repository (i.e. -- add the branch to the remote repo)
git push --set-upstream origin feature/123-add-git-instructions
```




While what is shown above are CLI commands, **you can replicate any CLI command using a Git GUI of your choice** -- all Git GUIs will have these commands available to them. [Android Studio has built-in git Version Control](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/version-control), and [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) is a recommended GUI for working with GitHub as well.

An additional Android Studio Git recommendation: [this link starting from step 4 is very useful](https://code.tutsplus.com/working-with-git-in-android-studio--cms-30514t)

### Cloning

Whenever you want to make a change to a repository, you need to first
clone it. Cloning a repository pulls down a full copy of all the
repository data, so that you can work on it locally. This copy includes
all versions of every file and folder for the project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/repo-name
```

You only need to clone the repository the first time. Before any
subsequent branches you can sync any changes from the remote repository
using `git pull`.

### Branching

To avoid adding code that has not been peer reviewed to the main branch
(ex. `develop`) we typically work in feature branches, and merge these
back to the main trunk with a Pull Request. It\'s even the case that
often the `main` or `develop` branch of a repository are locked so that
you can\'t make changes without a Pull Request. Therefore, it is useful
to create a separate branch for your local/feature work, so that you can
work and track your changes in this branch.

Pull the latest changes and create a new branch for your work based on
the trunk (in this case `develop`).

```bash
git pull

# checkout is used for commits, -b is a branch flag
git checkout -b feature/feature-name develop

# an alternative that does the same thing, "-c" to create the branch:
git switch -c feature/feature-name develop

# deleting a branch you don't need/created by mistake
git branch -d develop
```

At any point, you can move between the branches with
`git checkout <branch>` or `git switch <branch>` as long as you have committed or stashed your
work. If you forget the name of your branch use `git branch -a` to list all branches (see [Using remote branches](#using-remote-branches)).

### Committing

To avoid losing work, it is good to **commit often in small chunks**. This
allows you to revert only the last changes if you discover a problem and
also neatly explains exactly what changes were made and why.

1.  Make changes to your branch

2.  Check what files were changed

    ```bash
    > git status
    On branch feature/271-basic-commit-info
    Changes not staged for commit:
      (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
      (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
            modified:   source-control/git-guidance/README.md
    ```

3.  Track the files you wish to include in the commit. To track all
    modified files:

    ```bash
    git add --all
    ```

    Or to track only specific files:

    ```bash
    git add source-control/git-guidance/README.md
    ```

4.  Commit the changes to your local branch with a descriptive [commit
    message](#commit-best-practices)

    ```bash
    git commit -m "add basic git instructions"
    ```

### Pushing

When you are done working, push your changes to a branch in the remote
repository using:

```bash
git push
```

The first time you push, you first need to set an upstream branch as
follows. After the first push, the `--set-upstream` parameter and branch
name are not needed anymore.

```bash
git push --set-upstream origin feature/feature-name
```

Once the feature branch is pushed to the remote repository, it is
visible to anyone with access to the code.

## Managing remotes

A local git repository can have one or more backing remote repositories -- it's good to know what you are pushing your code to. You can list the remote repositories using `git remote` - by default, the remote repository you cloned from will be called *origin*:

```bash
> git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/microsoft/code-with-engineering-playbook.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/microsoft/code-with-engineering-playbook.git (push)
```

### Using remote branches

When you clone a repository with many branches (like my example [assignment 3 repository](https://github.com/michaelhaaf/5A6-F23-assignment3/)) it can appear like the only branch available is the default branch (here `main`):

```
$ git clone https://github.com/michaelhaaf/5A6-F23-assignment3/
$ cd 5A6-F23-assignment3
$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

# use git branch to view repository branches
$ git branch
* main
```

Using `git branch` alone only lists the currently existing local branches. We can see view remote branches using the following parameters:

- `git branch -r` list **remote** branches
- `git branch -a` list **all** branches (local and remote)

```
$ git branch -a
* main  # the astertix indicates local branch we have checked out
  origin/HEAD -> origin/main
  origin/main
  origin/nav-codelab
  origin/state-codelab

$ git branch -r
  origin/HEAD -> origin/main
  origin/main
  origin/nav-codelab
  origin/state-codelab
```

You can create and "switch" to a local copy of any existing remote with `git switch`:

```
$ git switch state-codelab
branch 'state-codelab' set up to track 'origin/state-codelab'.
Switched to a new branch 'state-codelab'

$ git branch -a
  main
* state-codelab
  origin/HEAD -> origin/main
  origin/main
  origin/nav-codelab
  origin/state-codelab
```

### Working with forks

You can set multiple remotes. This is useful for example if you want to
work with a forked version of the repository. For more info on how to
set upstream remotes and syncing repositories when working with forks
see GitHub\'s [Working with forks
documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/working-with-forks).

### Updating the remote if a repository changes names

If the repository is changed in some way, for example a name change, or
if you want to switch between HTTPS and SSH you need to update the
remote

```bash
    # list the existing remotes
    > git remote -v
    origin  https://hostname/username/repository-name.git (fetch)
    origin  https://hostname/username/repository-name.git (push)

    # change the remote url
    git remote set-url origin https://hostname/username/new-repository-name.git

    # verify that the remote URL has changed
    > git remote -v
    origin  https://hostname/username/new-repository-name.git (fetch)
    origin  https://hostname/username/new-repository-name.git (push)
```


## Commit Best Practices

*These notes are adapted from a [neat blogpost from GitHub with actual examples](https://github.blog/2022-06-30-write-better-commits-build-better-projects/) that you can follow along with*.

A commit combines changes into a logical unit. Adding a descriptive
commit message can aid in comprehending the code changes and
understanding the rationale behind the modifications. 

Commits should minimize the effort needed to build a mental model of the changes they introduce. With effort tied to having a “just right” amount of information, the key to a good commit is fitting into quantified upper and lower bounds on that information.

> A **small commit** is one with minimal scope; it does one “thing.” This often correlates to minimizing the modified lines of cone, but that isn’t a firm requirement. For example, changing the name of a commonly-used function may modify hundreds of lines of code, but its constrained scope makes it simple to both explain and review.

> A **commit is atomic** when it is a stable, independent unit of change. In concrete terms, a repository should still build, pass tests, and generally function if rolled back to that exact commit without needing other changes. In an atomic commit, your reader will have everything they need to evaluate the change in the commit itself.

Commits can be split and combined to adjust their size and scope -- tools for doing so are covered in later sections of this document.

### Commit Message Structure

The essential parts of a commit message are: 

- subject line: a short description of the commit, maximum 50 characters long
- body: Describe **what you’re doing** and **why** you’re doing it in the commit message.

Learn by example from famous open source developer [Tim Pope](https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html):

```
Capitalized, short (50 chars or less) summary

More detailed explanatory text, if necessary.  Wrap it to about 72
characters or so.  In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
subject of an email and the rest of the text as the body.  The blank
line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless you omit
the body entirely); tools like rebase can get confused if you run the
two together.

Write your commit message in the imperative: "Fix bug" and not "Fixed bug"
or "Fixes bug."  This convention matches up with commit messages generated
by commands like git merge and git revert.

Further paragraphs come after blank lines.

- Bullet points are okay, too

- Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, followed by a
  single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions vary here

- Use a hanging indent
```

I personally like to do the following:

```
lowercase, (because it's nicer to look at) short summary

Explanation (similar to Tim's note above, treat it like an email with a quick context paragraph)

Requirements resolved:
- One bullet point per discrete requirement (i.e. defined in an Issue, you could link it here)

Changes made:
- Each discrete code change is a separate bullet
- You should be able to look at this commit message next to the commit diff and see each change represented in a bullet
```

You can see examples in action through in my [partially-solved Assignment 3 Pull Request](https://github.com/michaelhaaf/5A6-F23-assignment3/pull/2), in case you are having trouble visualising this.

## Viewing git commits

*This section was adapted from [Atlassian: Advanced git log](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-log)*

The main reason for caring about [commit best practises](#commit-best-practices) is to make developing easier -- it seems like extra work at first, but after a while you start to see that [90% of coding is reading the code of others](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninety%E2%80%93ninety_rule) and it pays dividends to build habits that produce legible code.

We can immediately reap the benefits of concise and descriptive commits when viewing them with the `git log` tool. Even if the commit quality isn't that high, however, it's often very useful to be able to see the past series of changes to a codebase without having to click around on a website. 

There are many ways to improve the user experience of `git log` by taking advantage of some of its most useful parameters (this is common in git). We can even *compose* those parameters together to produce combinations of useful effects (which is a theme of this course). A few examples follow.

### Summarize with `git log --oneline`

The `--oneline` flag condenses each commit to a single line. By default, it displays only the commit ID and the first line of the commit message. Your typical `git log --oneline` output will look something like this:

```
0e25143 Merge branch 'feature'
ad8621a Fix a bug in the feature
16b36c6 Add a new feature
23ad9ad Add the initial code base
```

This is very useful for getting a high-level overview of your project.

### Include branch metadata with `git log --decorate`

Many times it’s useful to know which branch or tag each commit is associated with. The `--decorate` flag makes git log display all of the references (e.g., branches, tags, etc) that point to each commit.

This can be combined with other configuration options. For example, running `git log --oneline --decorate` will format the commit history like so:

```
0e25143 (HEAD, main) Merge branch 'feature'
ad8621a (feature) Fix a bug in the feature
16b36c6 Add a new feature
23ad9ad (tag: v0.9) Add the initial code base
```

This lets you know that the top commit is also checked out (denoted by `HEAD`) and that it is also the tip of the main branch. The second commit has another branch pointing to it called `feature`, and finally the 4th commit is tagged as `v0.9`.

Branches, tags, `HEAD`, and the commit history are almost all of the information contained in your Git repository, so this gives you a more complete view of the logical structure of your repository.


### Diff with `git log --stat` and `--patch`

The git log command includes many options for displaying diffs with each commit. Two of the most common options are `--stat` and `--patch`.

The `--stat` option displays the number of insertions and deletions to each file altered by each commit (note that modifying a line is represented as 1 insertion and 1 deletion). This is useful when you want a brief summary of the changes introduced by each commit. For example, the following commit added 67 lines to the `hello.py` file and removed 38 lines:

```
commit f2a238924e89ca1d4947662928218a06d39068c3
Author: John <john@example.com>
Date:   Fri Jun 25 17:30:28 2014 -0500

Add a new feature

 hello.py | 105 ++++++++++++++++++++++++-----------------
 1 file changed, 67 insertion(+), 38 deletions(-)
```

The amount of + and - signs next to the file name show the relative number of changes to each file altered by the commit. This gives you an idea of where the changes for each commit can be found.

If you want to see the actual changes introduced by each commit, you can pass the `-p` option to `git log`. This outputs the entire patch representing that commit:

```
commit 16b36c697eb2d24302f89aa22d9170dfe609855b
Author: Mary <mary@example.com>
Date:   Fri Jun 25 17:31:57 2014 -0500

Fix a bug in the feature

diff --git a/hello.py b/hello.py
index 18ca709..c673b40 100644
--- a/hello.py
+++ b/hello.py
@@ -13,14 +13,14 @@ B
-print("Hello, World!")
+print("Hello, Git!")
```

For commits with a lot of changes, the resulting output can become quite long and unwieldy. More often than not, if you’re displaying a full patch, you’re probably searching for a specific change. For this, you want to use the *pickaxe* option (see (#search-by-content)).

### "Pickaxe": Search by content with `git log -S`

It’s also possible to search for commits that introduce or remove a particular line of source code. This is called a *pickaxe*, and it takes the form of `-S""`. For example, if you want to know when the string Hello, World! was added to any file in the project, you would use the following command:

```
git log -S"Hello, World!"
```

If you want to search using a regular expression instead of a string, you can use the `-G""` flag instead.

This is a very powerful debugging tool, as it lets you locate all of the commits that affect a particular line of code. It can even show you when a line was copied or moved to another file.

### Branch overview with `git log --graph`

The `--graph` option draws an ASCII graph representing the branch structure of the commit history. This is commonly used in conjunction with the `--oneline` and `--decorate` commands to make it easier to see which commit belongs to which branch:

```
git log --graph --oneline --decorate
```

For a simple repository with just 2 branches, this will produce the following:

```
*   0e25143 (HEAD, main) Merge branch 'feature'
|\  
| * 16b36c6 Fix a bug in the new feature
| * 23ad9ad Start a new feature
* | ad8621a Fix a critical security issue
|/  
* 400e4b7 Fix typos in the documentation
* 160e224 Add the initial code base
```

The asterisk shows which branch the commit was on, so the above graph tells us that the 23ad9ad and 16b36c6 commits are on a topic branch and the rest are on the main branch.
