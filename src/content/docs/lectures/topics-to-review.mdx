This document covers topics you have seen in previous courses that will be important to understand new concepts in our course. 

It will be updated throughout the semester as we cover new ground -- that is, as we go through the course and I learn more about what you know! I encourage you to **be proactive** when it comes to this: let me know if there is something I say in class that is confusing, I will be happy to add more material explaining what I mean.

## Programming

### Primitive vs Derived Types

- Primitive types: You should be familiar with the basic set of primitive types in statically-typed languages like Java (int, byte, short, long, float, double, boolean, char). See [here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html) for reference. Crucially, primitive types **do not have interfaces, fields, or methods** that can be referenced.
- Arrays: A special kind of primitive type, arrays are [container objects](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/arrays.html) that hold a fixed number of values of a **single** type stored sequentially in memory.
- Derived types: More complicated types built from the primitive types in statically-typed languages like Java. Derived types have **defined interfaces**, allowing you to reference public fields or methods of that interface. [List](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/List.html) and [String](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html) are examples of built-in derived types in Java.

### Object Oriented Programming

In previous courses, you have gone beyond primitive and derived types to define your own classes and objects. You should be familiar with the following concepts:

- Classes and instances: You should understand the big picture of and be comfortable implementing [class definitions and objects instantiations of those classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object-oriented_programming#classes_and_instances) in object oriented programming.
- Inheritance: You should understand how to extend the behavior of class definitions by defining sub-classes of that type through [inheritance](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object-oriented_programming#inheritance). 
- Encapsulation: You should understand how and why to keep the state of an object instantiation private through [encapsulation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object-oriented_programming#encapsulation).
- Static fields/methods/properties: what is the effect of declaring `static` on a given class property? You can find a short summary [here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/variablesummary.html)

Some of the links above are Javascript examples, but the big picture is similar in Java/Kotlin.

## Respository management (git, GitHub)

In this course, we will be writing software in groups, as well as using software written by others. The most common way to share and distribute source code is in a [repository](). You have used [git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) and [GitHub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub) in the past for this purpose -- we will continue to do so in this course.

The sections below cover some of the main repository knowledge and techniques you should be familiar with to get started in this course.

A nice resource that covers the big picture of git and GitHub (they are different things), I recommend [this article from the Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-introduction-to-git).

### Setting up git on your machine

Whether on the lab computers (OS X) or on your personal machines, you should be able to:

- create git credentials: username/password/email/SSH key
- use CLI or GUI to manage repository changes

There are many resources available on these topics, so you are not limited to my suggestions, but [Getting started with git][git-setup] is a decent resource that covers all of them. [Setting up Git](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-setting-up-git) is also a resourse I recommend.

[git-setup]: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git 

### Retrieve and Upload software to a shared repository

You should be able to:

- Pull a remote repository on to your working machine
- Make and commit changes to the repository locally
- Create/manage/merge local branches
- Create pull requests to push branch commits to a remote repository

There are many resources available on these topics, so you are not limited to my suggestions, but [Using git][github-getting-started] is a decent resource that covers all of them.

[github-getting-started]: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git
