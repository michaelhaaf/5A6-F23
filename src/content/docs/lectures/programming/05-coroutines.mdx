*These notes are, in part, adapted from the Kotlinlang.org [Coroutines guide](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-guide.html)*

Kotlin provides only minimal low-level APIs in its standard library to enable other libraries to execute asynchronous tasks. Unlike other languages that you may be more familiar with (Java, C#, Javascript) that have asynchronous capabilities, `async` and `await` are not keywords in Kotlin and are not even part of its standard library -- nor are `futures` and `promises`. 

Rather, Kotlin introduces the concept of the **suspending function**, aiming to provide a safer and less error-prone abstraction for asynchronous operations than other languages. 

`kotlinx.coroutines` is a rich library for coroutines developed by JetBrains. It contains a number of high-level coroutine-enabled primitives that this guide covers, including launch, async, and others.

The following resources are recommended study material for understanding Kotlin coroutines, and the lecture notes below are based on them:

- [Coroutines basics](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-basics.html)
- [Asynchronous Flow](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/flow.html)


## Coroutine Basics

*This section is adapted from https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-basics.html*

A **coroutine** is an instance of a *suspendable computation*. What does that mean? All code aims to perform *computations* -- so **coroutines** are just *computations* that can be "suspended", paused, or treated separately from the main course of computations that take place on the CPU.

Coroutines are conceptually similar to a [Java thread](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Thread.html), in the sense that it takes a block of code to run that works *concurrently* with the rest of the code. However, a coroutine is not bound to any particular [CPU thread](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing)). It may suspend its execution in one thread and resume in another one.


### Example coroutine explained

The following code produces a kotlin coroutine:

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
import kotlinx.coroutines.*

fun main() = runBlocking { // this: CoroutineScope
    launch { // launch a new coroutine and continue
        delay(1000L) // non-blocking delay for 1 second (default time unit is ms)
        println("World!") // print after delay
    }
    println("Hello") // main coroutine continues while a previous one is delayed
}
```

 </TabItem>
 <TabItem label="Result">

Note well: `Hello` is printed before `World!`. Check the code in the other tab again -- is this what you would expect?

```
Hello
World!
```

 </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Let's dissect what this code does.

[`launch`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines/launch.html) is a coroutine builder. It launches a new coroutine concurrently with the rest of the code, which continues to work independently. **That's why Hello has been printed first**.

[`delay`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines/delay.html) is a special suspending function. It suspends the coroutine for a specific time. Suspending a coroutine does not block the underlying thread, but allows other coroutines to run and use the underlying thread for their code.

[`runBlocking`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines/run-blocking.html) is also a coroutine builder that bridges the non-coroutine world of a regular fun `main()` and the code with coroutines inside of `runBlocking { ... }` curly braces. This is highlighted in an IDE by `this: CoroutineScope` hint right after the `runBlocking` opening curly brace.

If you remove or forget `runBlocking` in this code, you'll get an `Unresolved reference: launch` error on the launch call.

The name `runBlocking` means that the thread that runs it (in this case the main thread) gets blocked for the duration of the call, until all the coroutines inside `runBlocking { ... }` complete their execution. 

You will often see `runBlocking` used like that at the very top-level of the application and quite rarely inside the real code, as threads are expensive resources and blocking them is inefficient and often not desired.

### CoroutineScope

Coroutines follow a principle of *structured concurrency* which means that new coroutines can only be launched in a specific [`CoroutineScope`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines/-coroutine-scope/index.html) which delimits the lifetime of the coroutine. The above example shows that `runBlocking` establishes the corresponding scope and that is why the previous example waits until `World`! is printed after a second's delay and only then exits.

In a real application, you will be launching a lot of coroutines. Structured concurrency ensures that they are not lost and do not leak. **An outer scope cannot complete until all its children coroutines complete**. Structured concurrency also ensures that any errors in the code are properly reported and are never lost.

### Launch a function

Let's extract the block of code inside `launch { ... }` into a separate function. When you perform "Extract function" refactoring[^1] on this code, you get a new function with the `suspend` modifier. 

```kotlin
import kotlinx.coroutines.*

fun main() = runBlocking { 
    launch { doWorld() }
    println("Hello")
}

/* 
Note: this is the result of doing "Extract function" on the code
inside of the launch block from the previous section. The behavior
of the code has not changed, but now it is easier to read.
*/
suspend fun doWorld() {
    delay(1000L)
    println("World!")
}
```

Functions with the `suspend` modifier -- suspending functions -- can be used inside coroutines just like regular functions, but their additional feature is that they can, in turn, use other suspending functions (like `delay` in this example) to suspend execution of a coroutine:

[^1]: "Extract Function" refers to a tool that Jetbrains IDEs like Android Studio and IntelliJ (and many others) provide -- when you highlight a chunk of code that can be replaced by a function, the IDE can determine how exactly to generate the function that would replace that code. See https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/extract-method.html

:::tip[Refactoring?]
We haven't explicitly covered the concept of [refactoring](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/extract-method.html) before, though what we learned about [git](/5A6-F23/lectures/development/01-git-basics) is intended to help do it. It's possible you have seen it in other classes, and it's certain you have *done* refactoring without necessarily knowing what it meant. In any case, what is refactoring exactly?

I like the definition provided on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring): "In computer programming and software design, **code refactoring** is the process of restructuring existing computer code -- changing the *[factoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decomposition_(computer_science))* -â€” without changing its external behavior. Refactoring is intended to improve the design, structure, and/or implementation of the software (its [non-functional attributes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-functional_requirement)), while preserving its [functionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_requirement)."

### Creating your own scope

In addition to the coroutine scope provided by functions like `runBuilder`, it is possible to declare your own scope using the [`coroutineScope`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines/coroutine-scope.html) builder. It creates a coroutine scope and does not complete until all launched children complete.

`runBlocking` and `coroutineScope` builders may look similar because they both wait for their body and all its children to complete. The main difference is that the `runBlocking` method **blocks** the current thread for waiting, while `coroutineScope` just **suspends**, *releasing the underlying thread for other usages*. Because of that difference, `runBlocking` is a regular function and `coroutineScope` is a suspending function.

You can use `coroutineScope` from any suspending function. For example, you can move the concurrent printing of Hello and World into a `suspend fun doWorld()` function.

Why do this? Well, we can launch more than one suspend function, without blocking any threads. Let's skip right away to an interesting example:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
import kotlinx.coroutines.*

// Sequentially executes doWorld followed by "Done"
fun main() = runBlocking {
    doWorld()
    println("Done")
}

// Concurrently executes both sections
suspend fun doWorld() = coroutineScope { // this: CoroutineScope
    launch {
        delay(2000L)
        println("World 2")
    }
    launch {
        delay(1000L)
        println("World 1")
    }
    println("Hello")
}
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Result">
```
Hello
World 1
World 2
Done
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


Both pieces of code inside `launch { ... }` blocks execute concurrently, with `World 1` printed first, after a second from start, and `World 2` printed next, after two seconds from start. A `coroutineScope` in `doWorld` completes only after both are complete, so `doWorld` returns and allows `Done` string to be printed only after that.


### The Italian Job

        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/L%C3%A9on_Bonnat_-_Job.jpg/440px-L%C3%A9on_Bonnat_-_Job.jpg" />

        <small>The Biblical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_(biblical_figure)">Job</a> is presented as a good man beset by horrendous disasters that take away all he holds dearâ€”a scenario intended to test Job's faith in God. Asynchronous programming may similarly test the CS student's faith in their programs; the <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines/-job.html"><code>Job</code></a> object can help them bring organization to a chaotic parallel world.</small>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

Remember how all <a href="/5A6-F23/lectures/programming/01-intro-to-kotlin#almost-everything-is-an-expression">Kotlin functions return a value</a>? The <code>launch</code> function is no exception: it returns a <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines/-job.html"><code>Job</code></a> object that is a handle to the launched coroutine and can be used to explicitly wait for its completion. 

This API should be familiar: `future` and `promise` objects in other languages have similar interfaces. 

For example, you can wait for completion of the child coroutine and then print "Done" string:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
val job = launch { // launch a new coroutine and keep a reference to its Job
    delay(1000L)
    println("World!")
}

println("Hello")
job.join() // wait until child coroutine completes
println("Done") 
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Result">
```
Hello
World!
Done
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Flow: Coroutines for Collections

*This section adapted from https://kotlinlang.org/docs/flow.html and https://www.baeldung.com/kotlin/collection-vs-sequence*

A suspending function asynchronously returns a single value, but how can we return multiple asynchronously computed values? This is where **Kotlin Flows** come in.

### Review: Representing multiple values with Collections

Multiple values can be represented and processed in Kotlin using [collections](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/collections-overview.html). 

For example, we can have a simple function that returns a `List` of three numbers and then print them all using `forEach`:

```kotlin
fun simple(): List<Int> = listOf(1, 2, 3)
 
fun main() {
    simple().forEach { value -> println(value) } 
}

// Output:
// 1
// 2
// 3
```

Operations like `forEach`, `map`, `filter`, etc. on collections like `List` are **eagerly evaluated**: *each operation* is performed on *every item* in the collection *immediately* and the *result* of the operation is *stored in a new collection*:

```kotlin
(1..100)
  .map { it * it } // Create a new list [1,4,9,16...10000]
  .filter { it % 2 == 0 } // Create a new list [4,16,...10000]
  .first { it > 50 } // Break loop when 64 > 50 is found
```

### Review: Lazy process multiple values with Sequences

`Sequences` are **lazily evaluated** â€” *each operation* is evaluated *on demand*. It does not create any intermediate new list on each operation. It emits *one item at a time*, passing it down and matching each item in the operation chain.

For example, we can modify the previous case by using a sequence to iterate over 100 items and find a number whose square is even number greater than 50:

```kotlin
(1..100).asSequence()
  .map { it * it }
  .filter{ it % 2 == 0 }
  .first{ it > 50 }
```

During the iteration, the chain of operations is applied to each item in the sequence one by one.

When the iteration starts, the `map()` operation squares it and passes its result to `filter().` If the `filter()` condition is true, it will pass the result to the `first()` operation, otherwise, it will skip the `first()` operation. For example, 1, 9, 25, and 49 are not passed down to `first()` because they fail the `filter()` condition.

**Lazy** evaluation is used to prevent expensive operations from taking place on an entire list, if not necessary. **Eager** evaluation is used in all other cases-- if you need to process every member of the list, it is better to be eager.

Returning to the first example, we can use `Sequence` to include a delay in the processing of each item in a list like so:

```kotlin
fun simple(): Sequence<Int> = sequence { // sequence builder
    for (i in 1..3) {
        Thread.sleep(1000) // pretend we are computing it
        yield(i) // yield next value
    }
}
fun main() {
    simple().forEach { value -> println(value) } 
}

// Output (1 second delay for each):
// 1
// 2
// 3
```

### New: Suspending functions for collections

The previous `sequence` computation blocks the main thread that is running the code every time `Thread.sleep(1000)` is called. 

To make this asynchronous code, we can mark the `simple` function with a `suspend` modifier, so that it can perform its work without blocking and return the result as a list:

```kotlin
suspend fun simple(): List<Int> {
    delay(1000) // pretend we are doing something asynchronous here
    return listOf(1, 2, 3)
}

fun main() = runBlocking<Unit> {
    simple().forEach { value -> println(value) } 
}
```

This code prints the numbers after waiting for a second between each number -- without blocking the main CPU thread.

### Flows: return a stream instead of a collection

Using the `List<Int>` result type, means we can only return all the values at once. To represent the stream of values that are being computed asynchronously, we can use a `Flow<Int>` type just like we would use a `Sequence<Int>` type for synchronously computed values.

The code below waits 1000ms before printing each number *without blocking the main thread*. This is verified by printing "I'm not owned" every 1000ms from a *separate coroutine* that is running in the main thread:

<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="Flow using suspend function">

```kotlin 
fun simple(): Flow<Int> = flow { // flow builder
    for (i in 1..3) {
        delay(1000) // pretend we are doing something useful here
        emit(i) // emit next value
    }
}

fun main() = runBlocking<Unit> {
    // Launch a separate coroutine to make sure the main thread is not blocked
    launch {
        for (k in 1..3) {
            println("I'm not owned $k") 
            delay(1000)
        }
    }

    // Collect the flow
    simple().collect { value -> println(value) } 
}

/* 
Output:  
NOTE: what would this look like if the main thread were blocked by simple()?
    (see the next tab for an example)
I'm not owned 1
1
I'm not owned 2
2
I'm not owned 3
3
*/
```

    </TabItem>

    <TabItem label="Flow using thread blocking function">

```kotlin 
fun simple(): Flow<Int> = flow { // flow builder
    for (i in 1..3) {
        Thread.sleep(1000) // pretend we are doing something useful here
        emit(i) // emit next value
    }
}

fun main() = runBlocking<Unit> {
    // Launch a separate coroutine to see if the main thread is blocked
    launch {
        for (k in 1..3) {
            println("I'm not owned $k") 
            delay(1000)
        }
    }

    // Collect the flow
    simple().collect { value -> println(value) } 
}

/* 
Output: Note how running simple().collect blocks the thread.
I'm not owned 1
1
2
3
I'm not owned 2
I'm not owned 3
*/
```

    </TabItem>

</Tabs>


Notice the following:

- A builder function of `Flow` type is called `flow`.
- Code inside a `flow { ... }` builder block can suspend.
- The `simple` function is no longer marked with a `suspend` modifier.
- Values are emitted from the flow using an `emit` function.
- Values are collected from the flow using a `collect` function.

Flows are *lazy* streams similar to sequences â€” the code inside a flow builder does not run until the flow is collected using `collect`. This becomes clear in the following example:

```kotlin
fun simple(): Flow<Int> = flow { 
    println("Flow started")
    for (i in 1..3) {
        delay(100)
        emit(i)
    }
}

fun main() = runBlocking<Unit> {
    println("Calling simple function...")
    val flow = simple()
    println("Calling collect...")
    flow.collect { value -> println(value) } 
    println("Calling collect again...")
    flow.collect { value -> println(value) } 

}

/* Output
Calling simple function...
Calling collect...
Flow started
1
2
3
Calling collect again...
Flow started
1
2
3
*/
```

This is a key reason the `simple` function (which returns a `flow`) is not marked with `suspend` modifier. The `simple()` call itself returns quickly and does not wait for anything. The flow starts afresh every time it is collected and that is why we see "Flow started" every time we call `collect` again.

### More detail about how Flows work

The above covers the big picture that is required to understand how to use `Flows` and coroutines. There is more to know: see https://kotlinlang.org/docs/flow.html#flow-cancellation-basics and the following sections for further details if you need them.
