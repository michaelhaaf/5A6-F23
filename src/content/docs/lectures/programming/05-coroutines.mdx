*These notes are, in part, adapted from the Kotlinlang.org [Coroutines guide](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-guide.html)*

Kotlin provides only minimal low-level APIs in its standard library to enable other libraries to execute asynchronous tasks. Unlike many other languages with similar capabilities, `async` and `await` are not keywords in Kotlin and are not even part of its standard library. Moreover, Kotlin's concept of suspending function provides a safer and less error-prone abstraction for asynchronous operations than futures and promises.

`kotlinx.coroutines` is a rich library for coroutines developed by JetBrains. It contains a number of high-level coroutine-enabled primitives that this guide covers, including launch, async, and others.

The following resources are recommended study material for understanding Kotlin coroutines:
