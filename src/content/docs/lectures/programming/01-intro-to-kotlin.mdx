## Why Kotlin? (why notlin?)

- General-purpose, statically-typed, open-source language
- Created by JetBrains â€“ the company who built IntelliJ IDEA and Android Studio
  - v1.0 released 2016
- It runs on a [Java Virtual Machine (JVM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine) and can be used anywhere Java is used
- Somewhat similar to Java, but has many simplifications in syntax and a variety of modern capabilities, such as null safety
  - Avoid boilerplate code
  - Avoid specifying types when unnecessary
- Android mobile development has been "Kotlin-first" since 2019
- Over 95% of the top thousand Android apps use Kotlin.
  - [https://kotlinlang.org/docs/android-overview.html](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/android-overview.html)
- Used by over 60% of professional Android developers
  - [https://developer.android.com/kotlin](https://developer.android.com/kotlin)
- 100% Java interoperable
  - Can call Java code from Kotlin and Kotlin code from Java
  - [https://kotlinlang.org/docs/java-interop.html](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/java-interop.html)
  - [https://kotlinlang.org/docs/java-to-kotlin-interop.html](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/java-to-kotlin-interop.html)

## Jetpack Compose

Part of the reason to learn Kotlin is to take advanage of Jetpack Compose. (what is that?)

* Modern declarative UI toolkit for component-based UI ("composables")
* Created by Google
  * V1.0 released July 2021
* 100% Kotlin
* Greatly simplifies the coding of UI for Android
  * Can cut development time in half
  * Is now the recommended approach to creating UIs for Android
* Conceptually similar to [React](https://react.dev/) and [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)
  * Similar declarative approach using components
  * Strong integration with Google's [Material Design](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/designsystems/material3)
* 24% of the top 1000 apps on Google Play have adopted Compose
  * [https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2023/05/whats-new-in-jetpack-compose.html](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2023/05/whats-new-in-jetpack-compose.html)
* Lots of great documentation to help you learn
  * [https://developer.android.com/courses/jetpack-compose/course](https://developer.android.com/courses/jetpack-compose/course)
  * [https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/documentation](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/documentation)

## Getting started

- Open Android Studio and follow the default setup steps for a new project.
* The default project ("Empty Activity") in Android Studio actually creates a Kotlin-Compose app
  * It is now the standard for Android app development
* There is a very cool new feature called "Live Edit", but it is only available in the very latest release of Android Studio and Gradle.
  * You may need to update (try doing that!)
* We'll walkthrough the project files to see what the basic setup is
  * Uses Gradle (build.gradle.kts) to specify dependencies on 3rd party packages
    * Analogous in some ways to using npm for Node.js, but all specified explicitly in a single place.  Gradle will download all required packages for you automatically.
  * Gradle also specifies various details for building the project (e.g., applicationId, minSdk level, version)
* Main entry point is "MainActivity.kt"
  * Single activity design

## Similarity to React (Web Dev II)

* Notice the rough similarity to React JSX
  * Nested UI components
    * `@Composable` indicates a UI component much like a JSX component
  * Named "properties" on components
    * Really are named parameters to functions in Kotlin
  * "Single Activity" design pattern
    * Similar in rough concept to single page app design of React
  * State management and re-render UI when state changes
    * Here we see a `ViewModel` class approach.  We'll also see parameter passing, the provider pattern, and storing state in variables (more similar to React).

## Concepts

What new features does Kotlin bring to the table that Java/any-other-programming language lacks?

### Null safety
- What normally happens when you try to reference an object that hasn't been created yet in your code? What can the consequences of that be? 
- What if the programming language we use just doesn't let you create null objects?
- The **type** system in Kotlin is designed around [Null safety](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/null-safety.html) -- that is, preventing the non-existence of data by design.

### Composable UI design
- What is a user interface? Not just in computing -- what other devices do you use on a regular basis?
- Is each part of the interface entirely separate? Can the interface be understood as a collection of components, or just as one universal whole?
- The answers to these questions have programming consequences! When does the **DRY** principle (do not repeat yourself) contradict the requirements of the interface? What is the least annoying way to repeat yourself when needed?
- [Composable design](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/mental-model) is emphasised in Kotlin: a complex user interface should be **de-composable** into constituent parts, and **re-composable** from previous solutions.

### Declarative UI
- Do you care whether the buttons in Moodle/Omnivox/whatever website are writtin in XML, HTML, JSON, ???
- When reading code, do you prefer to know **how** something is done, or **what** it does? Maybe there isn't just one answer to this question, but consider the most common scenario: you are tasked with making changes to a codebase written by others, that you are not familiar with, and you don't have very much time.
- Kotlin emphasises [Declarative design principles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsStyq4Lzxo) to prevent developers from having to reinvent the wheel each time a new component is added. Furthermore, declarative programming has the benefit of being much easier to read (interpret) than **procedural** programming.

:::tip[Programming paradigms]
What does it mean for a programming language to be considered [declarative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming) or [imperative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming)? What about [functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) or [object oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)? 

These terms are examples of [programming paradigms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm). We'll dive deeper into what exactly programming paradigms are, and what they have to do with application development, very soon. For now, it's okay to have a hazy understanding of these terms and try to pick up their meanings based on context. You can read links I have embedded above as well for reference.

## Similarities with Java

- Comments `//` or `/* */`
- Operators: `+ - * / % ++ -- = += -= *= /= %= == != > < >= <= && || !`
- `if` / `if-else` / `if-else-if`
- `while` / `do-while`
- `break` / `continue` / `return`
- Index arrays/strings starting at `0`
- Array API (access, append, delete, etc.)

## Differences from Java

- Semicolons are optional
- Declaring functions, parameters, return types
- Declaring variables / constants
  - Specifying types is optional
- No [primitive types](/lectures/00-topics-to-review/#primitive-vs-derived-types) - All types are objects (hence capitalized)
- Easy string interpolation using `$`
- How to create an array, list, etc.
  - Use `arrayOf()` `listOf()` `arrayListOf()` etc.

## Functions

The `fun` keyword is used to declare a function.

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Kotlin">
    ```kotlin
    fun main() {
      println("Hello World")
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Java">
    ```java
    public static void main() {
      System.out.println("Hello, World!"); 
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip
We don't need to add `public`: in Kotlin, `public` is the default visibility.
:::

Semicolons are optional! But, this means that line breaks are significant.

When a function has parameters, you must specify the type. Unlike in Java, the type is written **after** the parameter name, and is preceded by a colon:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Kotlin">
    ```kotlin
    fun greeting(message: String) {
      println(message)
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Java">
    ```java
    public static void greeting(String message) {
      System.out.println("Hello, World!"); 
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

If a function returns something, you must specify the return type.

- The return type is written after the parentheses containing the parameters and preceded by a colon (and is before the brace)
- If a function returns nothing, you can omit the type (i.e., no `void`!)

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Kotlin">
    ```kotlin
    fun augmentMessage(message: String) : String {
      return "This is the message: " + message;
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Java">
    ```java
    public static String augmentMessage(String message) {
      return "This is the message: " + message;
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


### Try it as we go 

[Clone this project to your directory for some exercises to do in class](https://github.com/tshussain/KotlinWithCompose.git)


In `App.kt`, replace "Hello World" with a call to `greeting()` with an appropriate argument

In the `App.kt` file, define a function called greeting.

As we learn more about functions and variables, play around with the function definition and the function call to try variations out.

To see the results of a println in Android Studio, select `View > Tool Windows > Logcat`

### Named arguments

One neat feature of Kotlin (that requires a bunch of [extra code to replicate in Java](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/builder-design-pattern-in-java)) is that functions can be called using [named arguments](https://www.baeldung.com/kotlin/default-named-arguments).

Normally, functions depend on being provided arguments in the order they are defined. This makes a function with many arguments difficult to interpret: imagine a function called `createShape` with four size parameters. When calling the function, that would look like `createShape(10, 20, 0.3, 123)` -- what does each parameter mean? What if you get the order wrong? 

Named arguments allow the function caller to **explicitly** specify the parameter for each argument in a function call. Here are some other examples:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Kotlin">
    ```kotlin
    // function definition
    fun greeting(name: String, age: Int) {
      println ("Hello $name, you are now $age old")
    }

    // function call (normal position argument) 
    greeting("Bobson", 123) // "Hello Bobson, you are now 123 old"

    // function call (new named argument -- look at how clear that is!)
    greeting(name="Bobson", age=123) // "Hello Bobson, you are now 123 old"

    // function call (we can even change the order. Why not?)
    greeting(age=123, name="Bobson") // "Hello Bobson, you are now 123 old"
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Java">
    ```java
    // function definition
    public static String greeting(String name, int age) {
      System.out.println(String.format("Hello %s, you are now %s old", name, age));
    }

    // function call (position argument function call)
    greeting("Bobson", 123); // "Hello Bobson, you are now 123 old"

    // function call (new named argument function call)
    greeting(name="Bobson", age=123); // Syntax error! This isn't a thing in Java. 
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Notice how much easier [string interpolation](https://www.baeldung.com/java-string-interpolation) is in Kotlin â€“ cool.

### Default arguments

Another feature impossible in Java without [a bunch of extra code](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/builder-design-pattern-in-java), A parameter in a function can be specified with a default value using the assignment operator:

```kotlin
fun greeting(name: String = "Unknown", age: Int = 10) {
  println ("Hello $name, you are now $age old")
}
```

Some, all or none of the parameters may have default values.

When calling a function, **a parameter with a default argument may be omitted**. In that case, the default value will be used.

As long as the omitted arguments are **last** in the parameter list, you can use positional arguments as well. The following are all valid:

- `greeting (age=5)`
- `greeting(name="Joe")`
- `greeting("Jane")`

These are not valid:

- `greeting(5)`
- `greeting(age=5, "Juan")`

Why aren't these valid? Positional arguments cannot be ambiguous -- it needs to be clear which parameter each positional argument is being assigned to. Don't worry about memorizing this -- it should make logical sense.

### Single expression / "One-Line" Functions

Just like in Java, for a function that has a single expression, the curly braces are optional. The following code snippets are equivalent:

```kotlin
fun convertToFahrenheit(degree : Float) : Float {
  return (degree * 9 / 5) + 32
}

fun convertToFahrenheit(degree : Float) = (degree * 9 / 5) + 32
```

## Variables

One of the major [differences from Java](#differences-from-java) mentioned above is that Kotlin does not have primitive types -- all types are defined objects. This causes Kotlin to have variable behavior that looks more like Javascript than Java, which is a handy way to remember the following:

- The `var` keyword is used to declare a variable that may change in value (similar to `let` in Javascript)
- The `val` keyword is used to declare a constant (similar to `const` in Java)

```kotlin
var name = "Joe"
val birthyear = 1985

name = "Bobson" // this is fine
birthyear = 1984 // Compiler error!
```

- Use of `val` is recommended where possible. 
- Cool feature: we don't have to specify a type â€“ Kotlin will figure it out based on the first assignment.
  - Once a type is assigned, it can't be changed.
- But, we can still specify a type if we wish. Unlike Java, the type is written after the variable name and preceded by a colon
- Let's see another example:

```kotlin
var height = 55
var name: String = "Joe"
val birthyear: Int = 1985

height = "fifty-five" // error!
name = 55 // error!
```

## Types

- Main types are:
  - Int
  - Double
  - Char
  - Boolean
  - String
  - Also: Float, Long, Short
  - Note: All capitalized (no primitive types!)
- Conversion: every type class has built-in conversion methods
  - You can convert one type to another using a toXXX() method on the object

```kotlin
value1.toInt() // throws an error only if value1 cannot be converted to an int
value2.toString() // doesn't matter what value2 is, this should always work
```

- All of the familiar Java built-ins are in Kotlin as well: `Double.MIN_VALUE`, `Integer.MAX_VALUE`, etc.
