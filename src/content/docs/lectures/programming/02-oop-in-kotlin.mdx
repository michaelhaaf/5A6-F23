## Terminology

- "Fields" (from Java) are generally called **properties**
- "Methods" (from Java) are called **class functions**
- visibility is **public** by default

:::tip
`public` (default) - visible across entire project

`private` – only visible in that file

`internal` – visible within same module

`protected` - visible inside that class AND that it is also visible in subclasses

## Classes

We're about to see one of the main [reasons to use Kotlin instead of Java](/lectures/programming/01-intro-to-kotlin/#why-kotlin-why-notlin), that is, the ability to "avoid boilerplate code". This is everywhere in Kotlin,  but **class definitions** are an especially clear example.

The best way to see this is just to look for yourself:

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Java">
    ```java
    /* 
        The following is a class called SomeClass. 
        It has a constructor, a private field, and a public setter/getter
    */
    public class SomeClass {
       private int someField;

       public SomeClass(int someField) {
          this.someField = someField;
       }

       public int getSomeField() {
          return someField;
       }

       public void setSomeField(int someField) {
          this.someField = someField;
       }
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Kotlin">
    ```kotlin
    /* 
        The following is a class called SomeClass. 
        It has a constructor, a property, and a public setter/getter for that property
    */
    class SomeClass(var someField : Int)
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

In the following sections, we'll deconstruct how this is achieved in Kotlin.

### Constructors

For a simple class, we can just define a constructor. Unlike Java, we don't have to explicitly define all the fields, etc.

```kotlin
class Car(var brand: String, var model: String, var year: Int)
```

Constructor arguments can have default values:

```kotlin
class Car(var brand: String,
          var model: String = "Unknown",
          var year:Int = 2022)
```

When calling a constructor in Kotlin, we don't use the 'new' keyword:

```kotlin
val c1 = Car("Ford", "Mustang", 1969)
```

Multiple constructors are possible (self-study).

#### Sample class with constructor & functions

```kotlin
class Car(var brand: String, var model: String, var year: Int) {
    // Class function
    fun drive() {
        println("Wrooom!")
    }
    // Class function with parameters
    fun speed(maxSpeed: Int) {
        println("Max speed is: " + maxSpeed)
    }
}
```

### Getter/Setter

Unlike java the getter and setter for a property of a class simply uses the name of the property; i.e. not `getX()` `setX()` etc..

```kotlin
val car = Car("Honda", "Camry", 2023)
println(car.brand)      // Access with .<property name>
car.model = "Civic"     // Set with .<property name>
println(civis.name)
```

#### No `static`

Kotlin does not have the `static` keyword.

If you want to create the equivalent to a static method in Kotlin, you can use [companion objects](#).

Companion objects are the singleton objects whose properties and functions are tied to a class but not to the instance of that class. Hence, we can access them just like a static method of the class.

Note that only one companion class is allowed per class. More than one companion object per class will lead to a runtime error in Kotlin.

```kotlin
class MyClass {
    companion object{
        fun myStaticMethod(): String{
            return "This method can be called without object"
        }
    }
}

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    println(MyClass.myStaticMethod())
}
```

### Inheritance

To allow a class to be subclassed, it must be defined with the keyword `open`. A class extends another using the colon syntax below:

```kotlin
// Superclass
open class MyParentClass {
    val x = 5
}
// Subclass
class MyChildClass: MyParentClass() {
    fun myFunction() {
        println(x) // x is now inherited from the superclass
    }
}
```

If the parent has constructor values, must also pass the appropriate constructor values when subclassing.

```kotlin
// Superclass
open class MyClass(var value:Int)

// Subclass
class SubClass(var value:Int, var otherValue:String): MyClass(value)
```

#### Overriding Functions

A function of a parent class cannot be overridden in a subclass unless the function in the parent is declared open.
The override keyword must also be used when defining the overridden function.

```kotlin
open class MyClass(var value:String) {
    open fun myFunction() {
        println(value)
    }
}

class SubClass(var value:String, var otherValue:String): MyClass(value) {
    override fun myFunction() {
        println(otherValue);
    }
}
```

Elsewhere:

```kotlin
val x = MyClass("Hi")
val y = SubClass("Hi", "Bye")
x.myFunction()
y.myFunction()
Should print out "Hi" then "Bye"
```

### Data classes

Kotlin offers different types of classes, e.g.,

- data classes
- enum classes
- sealed classes
  Data classes are a very useful concise way to define a class whose purpose is to store data.
- E.g., Similar to a "POJO" – plain old Java object or JavaBean
  [https://antonioleiva.com/data-classes-kotlin/](https://antonioleiva.com/data-classes-kotlin/)

## Null safety

Kotlin is designed as a null safe language. By default, variables in Kotlin cannot be set to `null`.

Instead, there is a [special nullable type](https://medium.com/mobile-app-development-publication/swift-optional-and-kotlin-nullable-a-comparison-773227f277c3) which allows you to use `null` subject to certain rules.

### `null` assignment rules

```kotlin
var str: String = "xyz"
str = null // Compile-time error
```

vs.

```kotlin
var str: String? = "xyz"
str = null // OK
```

### Nullable parameter handling

```kotlin
fun getLength(str: String?): Int? {
    return str.length // Compile-time error
}
```

Since str could be `null`, checking its length opens you up to the possibility of a null pointer error. Instead:

```kotlin
fun getLength(str: String): Int? {
    return str.length // OK
}
```

We can also **explicitly** check for null ("old-school" way)

```kotlin
fun getLength(str: String?): Int? {
    if (str != null) {
        return str.length // OK
    }
    return 0
}
```

Or can use the [safe call operator](#) `?`.

```kotlin
fun getLength(str: String?): Int? {
    return str?.length // OK
}
```

This returns null if the given _str_ string is null

### Java vs. Kotlin Example

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Java">
    ```java
    public ZipCode getZipCode(User user) {
      if (user != null) {
        if (user.getAddress() != null)
          return user.getAddress().getZipCode();
        }
        return null;
      }
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Kotlin">
    ```kotlin
    fun getZipCode(user: User?): ZipCode? {
      return user?.address?.zipCode;
    }

    // This is an equivalent one-liner
    fun getZipCode(user: User?): ZipCode? = user?.address?.zipCode
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Exercises

- In class, we used a [sample Compose application](https://github.com/tshussain/KotlinWithCompose) to demonstrate the new Kotlin behaviors we have seen in the past few lectures on a simple Android GUI. Make sure you can understand and replicate all of the examples given in this lecture and the [previous lecture](/lectures/programming/01-intro-to-kotlin).
- **Recommended**: The [Google Developer Kotlin Bootcamp](https://developer.android.com/courses/kotlin-bootcamp/overview) is highly recommended for following along with the course so far. At this point, you should know enough to complete all the way to the end of **Lesson 4**.
