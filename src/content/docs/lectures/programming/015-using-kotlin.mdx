description: The various ways to compile, build, and run Kotlin programs, libraries, and scripts

## The fundamentals

### Source code: `.kt`, `.kts`

### Compilers: `kotlinc`

### Gradle

Gradle is a JVM-based build system that enables developers to write **high-level** **scripts** that can be used to automate the process of compilation and application production. It is a flexible plugin-based system, which allows you to automate various aspects of the build process; including compiling and signing an .apk, downloading and managing external dependencies, or utilising specific SDK versions. 

```Note
Gradle and the Android Gradle plugin run independent of Android Studio. This means that you can build your Android apps from within Android Studio, the command line on your machine, or on machines where Android Studio is not installed, such as continuous integration servers.

If you aren't using Android Studio, you can learn how to build and run your app from the command line. The output of the build is the same whether you are building a project from the command line, on a remote machine, or using Android Studio.

$ java -jar main.jar
```

## Scripting Kotlin


# Setting up

Before you can write code and run programs, you need to:

Create a file in your project
Create a main() function
Pass arguments to main()( Optional  )
Use any  passed  arguments in function calls  (  Optional  )
Run your program

# Create a new Kotlin file

In  IntelliJ IDEA's  Project pane,  under   Hello World  ,    right-click the src folder.

Select  New > Kotlin File/Class .

Select  File , name the file Hello, and press  Enter .

# Create a Kotlin file

You should now see a file in the src folder called Hello.kt.

# Create a main() function

main() is the entry point for execution for a Kotlin program.

In the Hello.kt file:

<span style="color:#3F51B5">fun</span>  <span style="color:#37474F"> main(args: Array<String>) {</span>

<span style="color:#37474F">    println(</span>  <span style="color:#388E3C">"Hello, world!"</span>  <span style="color:#37474F">)</span>

<span style="color:#37474F">}</span>

<span style="color:#3C4043">The </span>  <span style="color:#3C4043">args</span>  <span style="color:#3C4043"> in the </span>  <span style="color:#3C4043">main()</span>  <span style="color:#3C4043"> function are optional.</span>

---

As with other languages, the Kotlin main() function specifies the entry point for execution. Any command line arguments are passed as an array of strings.

Like your earlier printHello() function, this function has no return statement. Every function in Kotlin returns something, even when nothing is explicitly specified. So a function like this main() function returns a type kotlin.Unit, which is Kotlin's way of saying no value.

Note: When a function returns kotlin.Unit, you don't have to specify it explicitly. This is different from some other languages, where you have to explicitly say that you are returning nothing.



# Run your Kotlin program

To run your program, click the Run icon (  ) to the left of the main() function.

IntelliJ IDEA runs  the program , and displays the results in the console.

# Pass arguments to main()

Select  Run > Edit Configurations  to open the  Run/Debug Configurations  window.

---

Enter Kotlin! in the Program arguments field, and click OK.

Because you are running your program from IntelliJ IDEA and not from the command line, you need to specify any arguments to the program a little differently.

# Use arguments in main()

Use args[0] to access the first input argument passed to main().

---

In the previous slide, we passed "Kotlin!" as an argument to main.

In Hello.kt, change the greeting message to use the first argument passed into the program (via the Run/Debug Configurations window on the previous slide), args[0], instead of "world".

This example uses a string template. String templates let you reference variables inside string declarations.
