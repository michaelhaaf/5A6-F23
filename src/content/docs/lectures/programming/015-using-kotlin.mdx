## Getting started

### Create a main() function

`main()`, or optionally `main(args: Array<String>)`, is the entry point for execution for a Kotlin program.

As with other languages, the Kotlin main() function specifies the entry point for execution. Any command line arguments are passed as an array of strings.

```kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
  println(  "Hello, world!"  )
}
```

The main function has no return statement. [Every function in Kotlin returns something](/lectures/01-intro-to-kotlin), even when no return type is explicitly specified. 

Note: When a function returns `kotlin.Unit` you don't have to specify it explicitly. This is different from some other languages, where you have to explicitly say that you are returning nothing.

## Android Studio** and IntelliJ

### Run your Kotlin program

To run your program, click the Run icon to the left of the `main()` function. Android Studio runs the program, and displays the results in the console.

### Pass arguments to main()

In the top menu, select `Run > Edit Configurations` to open the Run/Debug Configurations window.

You can enter a set of command line arguments to be passed to your `main` function in the **Program arguments field**. Each argument is separated by a space; so arguments that have spaces inside of them should be "wrapped in quotation marks".

### Access arguments in `main()`

The `args` parameter is a String array: you can use array indices to access the arguments. E.g. `args[0]` to access the first input argument passed to main(), `args[1]` to access the second, etc.
### IntelliJ

## Command line

```bash
$ kotlinc main.kt -include-runtime -d main.jar
$ java -jar main.jar
```

### Gradle

Gradle is a JVM-based build system that enables developers to write **high-level** **scripts** that can be used to automate the process of compilation and application production. It is a flexible plugin-based system, which allows you to automate various aspects of the build process; including compiling and signing an .apk, downloading and managing external dependencies, or utilising specific SDK versions. 

```Note
Gradle and the Android Gradle plugin run independent of Android Studio. This means that you can build your Android apps from within Android Studio, the command line on your machine, or on machines where Android Studio is not installed, such as continuous integration servers.

If you aren't using Android Studio, you can learn how to build and run your app from the command line. The output of the build is the same whether you are building a project from the command line, on a remote machine, or using Android Studio.
