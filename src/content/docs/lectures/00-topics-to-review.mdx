This document covers topics you have seen in previous courses that will be important to understand new concepts in our course. 

It will be updated throughout the semester as we cover new ground -- that is, as we go through the course and I learn more about what you know! I encourage you to **be proactive** when it comes to this: let me know if there is something I say in class that is confusing, I will be happy to add more material explaining what I mean.

## Programming

### Primitive vs Derived Types

### Object Oriented Programming

## Respository management (git, GitHub)

In this course, we will be writing software in groups, as well as using software written by others. The most common way to share and distribute source code is in a [repository](). You have used [git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) and [GitHub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub) in the past for this purpose -- we will continue to do so in this course.

The sections below cover some of the main repository knowledge and techniques you should be familiar with to get started in this course.

### Setting up git on your machine

Whether on the lab computers (OS X) or on your personal machines, you should be able to:

- create git credentials: username/password/email/SSH key
- use CLI or GUI to manage repository changes

There are many resources available on these topics, so you are not limited to my suggestions, but [Getting started with git][git-setup] is a decent resource that covers all of them.

[git-setup]: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git 

### Retrieve and Upload software to a shared repository

You should be able to:

- Pull a remote repository on to your working machine
- Make and commit changes to the repository locally
- Create/manage/merge local branches
- Create pull requests to push branch commits to a remote repository

There are many resources available on these topics, so you are not limited to my suggestions, but [Using git][github-getting-started] is a decent resource that covers all of them.

### Software Lifecycle

## Computer Science

## Miscellany

### i.e. vs e.g.
