Final project presentations and deliverables marking scheme/links to instructions follow below.

Worth: 25% of overall grade.

**Most of your instructions have already been added to your project GitHub as a set of issues**! This document just centralizes the information in one place.

## Marking scheme

The grade you/your teammates receive is schemed out of 250 marks total:

### (75) Project management

#### (25) CI/CD Requirements

- Project code is built/linted before pulled into `main`
    - **See the "Enforce build on pull request/push" issue I created in your repository for more information.**
    - **See the "Enforce code quality and style" issue I created in your repository for more information.**
- Project code uses appropriate grade/sdk versions 
    - **See the "Update Gradle/SDK Versions" issue I created in your repository for more information.**
- Application releases are published to Firebase using a GitHub workflow
    - **See the "Implement Firebase App Distribution Workflow" issue I created in your repository for more information.**

#### (20) git/GitHub Requirements

- Coding contributions by each member will be made clear by strict branch management (pull requests into main for release-ready changes, separate branches for testing/development)
- to best of ability, all changes are reviewed/tested before pull into `main`;
- to best of ability, commits are **atomic** (see [course notes][atomic-git] on this subject); 
- to best of ability, pull requests are linear series of commits, linear branch history is maintained

#### (30) Documentation Requirements

- Issues are used effectively, relevant, clearly written, and their statuses are up to date by project deadline.
- Wiki+Readme+Project polished and up to date 
    - **See the "README" and "Wiki" issues I created in your repository for more information.**
- A developer release has been made available for your project code and is documented on your GitHub
    - **See the "Dev Release" issue I created in your repository for more information.**
- A production release has been made available for your project code and is documented on your GitHub
    - **See the "Prod Release" issue I created in your repository for more information.**
- You have chosen a license for your project code.
    - **See the "Choose a license" issue I created in your repository for more information.**

### (125) Overall Requirements

#### (65) Functionality Requirements

- Meet the business logic requirements as per your design proposal
- Meet the technical and functional requirements set by the teacher (see below) 
- Use a declarative UI approach (Compose) with separation of concerns between display and data (e.g., MVVM approach)
- Apply the key techniques taught in class for state management (including ViewModel), user authentication, navigation, coroutines & flow, Material 3 design, layout, etc.
- Persist data provided by the user (Local storage or remote database)
- Include a user login/register capability with associated serverless authentication (e.g., Firebase)
- Implement a navigation approach that allows user to move to different screens and that works with device back button (e.g., NavBar, but other approaches are possible)
- Prevent access to some UI elements and associated access based on whether user is logged in or not.
- Include an “About Us” screen that describes your team and the motivation for the app.
- Include at least one information screen in addition to the About Us screen.
- Include at least three functional screens (not including login/landing/about-us/info)
- The user should be able to perform all interactions with the application by starting the app and then navigating appropriately within the app.
- User inputs should be handled appropriately (e.g., hide password, some minimal form of validation)
- The application should not hang or crash
- Include 1 “advanced feature” suggested in class.
    - **See the "Advanced Feature" issue I created in your repository for more information.**

#### (20) Aesthetic/Styling/Layout

- All screens use Material design and share a common look and feel.
- How well did your app meet the soft requirements and your design aesthetics? Does it have a good aesthetic design? 
    - **See the "Material Design & Style Refactor" issue I created in your repository for more information**

#### (20) Usability/Design

- Is your app usable? How useful is the app? Are instructions to the user clear (where needed)? Does the app provide a cohesive experience?
- The principles learned in the Assignment 4 codelab have been applied to your project 
    - **See the "Accessibility" issue I created in your repository for more information.**

#### (20) Code quality

- Kotlin/Compose best practises and uniform style are applied
    - **See the "Enforce coding quality and style requirements using Spotless" issue I created in your repository for more information**
- Important source code files must be appropriately documented meaningfully.
    - **See the "Comments and Attributions" issue I created in your repository for more information**
- Source code project name/package name is appropriate (not EmptyActivity or Assignment2 or similar)
    - **See the "Project/Package name" issue I created in your repository for more information**

### (50) Individual contribution 


#### (10) Self evaluation

See form distributed on Teams

#### (10) Peer evaluation

See form distributed on Teams

#### (30) Teacher evaluation

Informed by the above two evaluations, as well as my own evaluation of your contributions to this project. I will base my assessment off code and documentation changes that are visible to me on GitHub. Make sure all team members are contributing code and managing the project issues/documentation!
