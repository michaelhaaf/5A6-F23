This milestone (and all following milestones) will be a group project, completed in teams of 2-3.

## Goals

- Review basic mechanics of application deployment using GitHub
- Understand how Kotlin projects are built into applications using Gradle
- Understand the Android development stack

## Requirements

The course project will see your groups create a complete Android application over the course of the semester. 

This milestone starts things off by having you set up an automated development environment on GitHub -- we will build on this repository as the semester progresses with more sophisticated features.

The basic requirements for Milestone 1 build on skills you learned last semester: 

- create a repository shared amongst your teammembers 
- write a GitHub actions `.yml` file to automate building your source code
- maintain the a clean repository history with appropriate usage of [branch protection](), [pull requests](), [commit messages](), and the [merge](), [rebase](), and [squash]() commands
- document the usage of your project using a repository README

You will also be expected to:

- 
- make use of Gradle in your GitHub action workflow to build your Kotlin project
- manage dependencies (JDK version)

Each of these requirements is explained in more detail in the subsections below.

### Code

Requirement TBD

### git best practices

> An **atomic commit** is a commit that includes changes related to only one feature or task of your program. There are two main reasons for doing this: first, if something you change turns out to cause some problems, it is easy to revert the specific change without losing other changes; and second, it enables you to write better commit messages.

### README

- Group name and members
- 

### Create shared repository

### Automated build using GitHub action 

- `.github/workflow` yaml: just a build step for now, we will make it more sohpisticated thruought semester
