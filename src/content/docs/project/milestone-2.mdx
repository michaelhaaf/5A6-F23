title: "Milestone 2: Starting your own application"
description: "We'll pick up where we left off with the last milestone by creating our own application repository.

In this milestone, we'll prepare our application for development by creating a repository and committing our development framework (JetPack Compose), documentation files, and Continuous Integration/Development pipelines. That way, our future development work can benefit from continuous testing and documentation as we develop."
