The course project will see your groups collectively scope, define, implement, and deliver a complete Android application over the course of the semester. In this milestone, you will set up a group repository and draft a technical proposal for your Android project.

*Major portions of this assignment were adapted from [CS 346](https://student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs346/1231/index.html), a similar course at UWaterloo.* 

## Goals

The goal of this milestone isn't to plan your a perfect project proposal, but rather to set up your teams on the best footing possible for adapting to changing requirements and making continuous progress throughout the semester.

By the end of this milestone, you will have done the following:

  - Determine what to build (requirements analysis).
  - Determine what features to implement and how they interact (design).
  - Implement a skeleton CI/CD procedure
  - Apply sane repository management practises so that your project can maintain throughout the semester:
    - clean main branch
    - numbered versions with each release
    - each release proven to build run and compile into a usable android project

## Requirements

This milestone kicks off your project by having you complete the following tasks:

  - Create a group repository to track contributions, store documentation, and marshall required project infrastructure for automated CI/CD throughout the semester
  - Create a project README that documents the major goals of the project, the technical roadmap for attaining those goals, and associated risk analysis/mitigation strategies.
  - Implement an initial landing page for your application to prove that your repository infrastructure works, released as version `0.1`

### Repository

This milestone starts things off by having you set up an automated development environment on GitHub -- we will build on this repository as the semester progresses with more sophisticated features.

The basic development environment requirements for Milestone 2 build on skills you learned last semester: 

- Create a repository shared amongst your teammembers 
- Write a GitHub actions `.yml` file to automate CI/CD of your source code
- Maintain a clean repository history with your teammembers

You can find more details about each of these requirements below.

#### GitHub repository management

- Give the project a meaningful name
- Make the repository **private**. You will add yourself your team members and myself (michaelhaaf) to this project later.
- Initialize with a README.md file, and see below for suggestions on formatting and contents.
- [Choose a license](https://choosealicense.com/)

Once the repository is created:

- Create a [branch protection rule](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/managing-a-branch-protection-rule) for the default `main` branch. Read through the document linked and make sure you udnerstand all of the options listed.
  - Ensure that "Require status checks to pass before merging" is enabled.
  - Ensure that "Require pull request reviews before merging" is enabled. 

These steps will allow all group members to freely develop on their own branches, test deployments on their own branches, and then REQUIRE that merges to the main branch are reviewed by team members and pass the CI/CD pipeline steps.

Your commits in general should be **atomic**, that is:

> An **atomic commit** is a commit that includes changes related to only one feature or task of your program. There are two main reasons for doing this: first, if something you change turns out to cause some problems, it is easy to revert the specific change without losing other changes; and second, it enables you to write better commit messages. ([The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-git-basics))

#### CI/CD

- [Android CI-CD using Github Actions](https://blog.logrocket.com/android-ci-cd-using-github-actions/)
- [Securely create android release using Github Actions](https://proandroiddev.com/create-android-release-using-github-actions-c052006f6b0b)
- [Github Actions and Gradle](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/github-actions.html)

### README

You should have a markdown file in the root of your source code repository named `README.md`. This will serve as a landing-page for your project (i.e. its the first thing that users will see when visiting your project page). It should contain the following sections.

```markdown title="README.md"
# PROJECT NAME

## Goal
A brief description of your product. What is it? What does it do?

## Team members
List each person's name and email address.

## Quick-start
How to install and launch your application. 

## Screenshots/videos
Optional, but often helpful to have a screenshot or demo-video for new users.

## Releases
Each push to your main branch should produce a software release that is built and compiled. The README should list of releases, including links to release notes. For this milestone, your versioning should be in the form 0.X, like so

version 0.1: released [Oct 20th, 2023]
	* release-notes (txt or md)
	
version 0.2: released [subsequently]
	* release-notes (txt or md)

...

version 1.0: final project milestone

## Roadmap
Issue tracking: each issue represents a requirement that you wish to implement or a task/issue that needs to be resolved. You should document your progress in the issue, and close it when the work is complete.


```

#### Roadmap

The Roadmap section of your documentation should answer the following questions:

  - What is the goal of the project?
  - Can you break down the large goal into smaller requirements?
  - How will you delegate these tasks?
  - What risks have you identified in your requirements? Do you have strategies to mitigate those risks?

See the links below for setting up a roadmap in a GitHub project:

- 30%: GitHub Actions 
- 30%: Roadmap
- 10%: GitHub repository best practises (commit messages, branch management)

## Tips and Resources

### Testing your Deployments

You might wonder -- with such strict requirements about your main branch and CI/CD, what happens if you accidentally push code to main that does not build?

The answer: **DON'T DO IT**. As shown in the [instructions above (not written yet)](), you should **stage** your source code changes so that your commits are tested on the CI/CD pipeline as an essential part of your pull request procedure.
