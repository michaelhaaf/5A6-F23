## Milestone #1: Mobile Application Requirements, Design and Planning Document

* Worth 10% of grade\.  Due June 20\, midnight\.  This is a Group activity with individual responsibilities\.
* For this deliverable\, you will create a requirements\, design and planning document that provides an actionable plan for developing the project within the time available\. A self\-report on team member contributions is also required\.
* The document will have a title page and 3 parts\, each with appropriate subsections\.
  * There is no specific required length for each part\.  But marks will be given based on quality and completeness\.
    * Some likely page ranges are given that assume an appropriate amount of prose and a moderate number and size of images\.
  * Use prose with full sentences wherever possible in Parts A & B\.  Bulleted lists with short notes will not be marked highly\.
* __Title Page__ : The document should have a title page indicating the authors
  * Recommend giving a name to your team
  * Recommend giving a name to your project
* __Part A__ : Determine and document the requirements for the business logic of your mobile application for the group project\.
  * __Introduction with Motivation:__  Give the motivations for your project \-\- what inspired it and what you hope to achieve\.
    * e\.g\.\, what kind of problem are you trying to solve\, what kind of capability to you want to provide the user\, what kind of experience do you want to give the user\.
    * Try to link these motivations to each team member if possible\.
  * __Business Logic Requirements:__  Identify your data needs\, user interface requirements\, key required operations and any data dependencies\.  Highlight any validity constraints on the data\.  Describe any "rules" that will apply \(e\.g\.\, all entries must have a name and title\, but optionally an image; all users must have a profile indicating their name\, age and seating preference; all spells must have a type\, title and area of effect\, but may belong to multiple schools; all artist names must be unique; no two items may be placed in the same location\, etc\.\)\.
    * Note: This is not a set of "features"\.  This is a description of what your application needs to be able to do in order to be considered a success\.
  * This part will likely run 1\.5 pages\.

* __Part B__ : Design and document a coherent\, consistent app that will meet those business logic requirements as well as the technical\, functional and soft requirements of the project\.
  * __Interface Design:__  Describe the inspiration for your interface design\.  Provide mock\-ups of the interface\, sufficient to identify the aesthetics and key functionality\.  This section should clearly inform UI development\.
    * A mock\-up should be given for each key feature/screen\.
    * Mockups may be created with computer software or hand\-drawn\.
    * Each mockup should have some prose description describing it \(not too long – a couple sentences to a paragraph depending on complexity\)
  * __Database Design__ : Describe your anticipated database design\.  \(e\.g\.\, using UML or other appropriate description\)\.  What are the different data sets\, what are the fields of data\, how are they related to each other
    * Note: We are using schema for our Realm objects\, so this is essentially indicating what those schema are\.
  * __Application Features: __ Describe the features of the application\.  A feature should be discussed in terms of the UI elements\, user actions\, the specific functionality and the requirement\(s\) it is in service of\.  A feature should be indicated as a "Must\-Have" or as a "Nice\-to\-Have"\.
    * Give sentences\, not short bullets\.
  * __Coding Techniques/technologies – The unique stuff:__  Normally\, you'd include a detailed description of the coding techniques and technologies that would be used even if they were largely in line with what we have done in class\.  However\, due to the short time for this deliverable\, you do not have to do that\.  Instead\, just document whether there you are planning to use techniques or technologies not covered in class\.
  * The goal of this design section is to be as comprehensive as possible in specifying what you will implement and how\.  But\, you are allowed to adapt things as appropriate as development proceeds\.  E\.g\.\, a technique turns out to be too hard\, a 3rd party tool doesn't meet the need the way you thought it would\, you identify a new technique that could add some interesting functionality\, etc\.
  * This part will likely run 3 pages of text plus multiple pages of mockup images\, as appropriate\.

* __Part C: __ Create a development plan for successfully completing the project within the available time period until June 30\.
  * The plan must include a  __timeline__ \, a  __tasking plan__  and a  __coordination plan__
  * The  __timeline__  indicates the anticipated dates for key milestones/accomplishments of the project\.
    * Some key milestones to include in your timeline are:
      * June 20 – Milestone 1 – This design and planning document due
      * June 26 \(likely\) – Milestone 2 \(preliminary demo\)
      * June 30 – Final demo and project deliverables due
      * When key features are planned to be completed
      * When testing of key features will be completed
      * Note: Give yourself appropriate time to test your final submission after ALL final code changes\.
    * The timeline may be given visually or in a list or table format\.
  * The  __tasking plan __ indicates\, as much as possible\, all the tasks involved in the project and who those tasks are assigned to\.  You may break tasks up into subtasks as appropriate\.
    * Each task should be detailed with a short prose description at least one sentence long\.  More complex tasks should be given more detailed descriptions\.
    * As much as possible\, indicate any dependencies between tasks\,
    * All tasks should be assigned their own anticipated deadline\.  This is not a hard deadline \(unless it is assigned June 30\)\, but should reflect dependencies and should guide your team's priorities\.  "Nice\-to\-Haves" should generally not be given priority over "must\-haves"\.
    * The tasking plan may be done in mostly list format or in a table format\.
      * E\.g\.\, A table with the columns Task Number\, Task Description\, Dependencies\, Assigned To\, Deadline
  * The  __coordination plan __ indicates how your team will work together on this project\, including coding coordination \(e\.g\.\, git\)\, document coordination \(e\.g\.\, git\, sharepoint\, google doc\,\, etc\) and communication coordination \(e\.g\.\, Teams\, in\-person meetings\, etc\.\)\.  The coordination plan should include a schedule of planned meetings or shared coding sessions for ensuring the team stays on track\.  Finally\, each team member should include a  __commitment message __ indicating that you will be able to follow this plan\.
    * Note: If the coordination plan does not feel like it will work for you \(e\.g\.\, teammates want to work on the weekend but you have a part\-time job\)\, then this is the time to be up\-front and tell them what you can commit to and what you can't \(e\.g\.\, willing to stay after class each day for an hour to meet since you can't make weekends\)\.
  * This part will likely run 2 to 3 pages and may be mostly tabular in nature\.

* Each team member must write a meaningful percentage of the document\.
  * Recommend splitting up the different portions of the document into sections and having different team members write different sections\.
  * Authorship of all portions of content must be indicated \(e\.g\.\, name next to section header\, name next to image\)\.
  * Statements such as "all members contributed equally to all sections" may result in lower marks\.  You may contribute equally to the creative ideas\, but must partition up the writing tasks\.
  * Doing a quality control review of the document together as a team to ensure quality\, completeness \(and consistency\) is recommended\.
* __Self\-Report: __ Finally\, along with the document\, each team member must submit a rating of the contribution for themselves and each team member on a scale of 1 to 10\.  For each member\, including yourself\, please give a short sentence or two describing their effort\.
  * E\.g\.\,
    * Me: 8\.5 \- Got a little behind and Jane had to take on one of my writing tasks \(section 3\.5\)\.
    * Joe: 9\.5 \- He did a great job and made caught a lot of mistakes in the document during review\.  Didn't always show up to meetings though\.
    * Jane: 10 \- She went above and beyond and helped keep us on track\.
  * Details should be given on any lack of or poor participation so that undue reward is not given\.  In such cases\, provide details\.  Ideally\, bring such issues to my attention as early as possible so they can be addressed\.
* Marking Scheme:
  * 25% Quality and Completeness of Business Logic Requirements
  * 40% Quality and Completeness of Design
  * 20% Quality and Details of Development Plan \(Timeline: 5%\, Tasking Plan: 10%\, Coordination Plan: 5%\)
  * 20% Individual contributions to document \(Will be based on self\-reports and teacher assessment\)
    * Note: Low participation will result in penalties for that individual on other marking categories as appropriate based on their actual contributions\.

* Submission:
  * Submit the document on Lea\.  Note: This is a single document\.
  * Only one teammate needs to submit\.
  * Only the latest version submitted will be marked\.
  * You will also present your design to the class the morning after the milestone is due\. You may just use the document itself while presenting \(no slides required\)\.
* Late Penalty:
  * Late submissions lose 10% per day to a maximum of 1 day\.
  * Nothing accepted after 1 day and a grade of zero may be given\.
* Original work\!
  * "Your submitted work must be clear\, complete\, and YOUR OWN\.  You must be prepared to explain any of your work to me in person\.  Failure to be able to defend your work\, or do a similar question in front of me in person can/will void any grade you get on this assignment/milestone\."
  * You may include some content from 3rd party sources \(e\.g\.\, design elements for illustration purposes\) but must cite any sources you use\.  3rd party content cannot be a substantial portion of the total document\.
    * If you are unsure whether to include certain 3rd party content\, then ask in advance in writing via MIO or Teams \(Include all teammates\)
  * If you decide to experiment with generative AI\, then clearly indicate which portions of the document were generated\.  Generated content cannot be a substantial portion of the total document\.
    * If you are unsure whether to include certain generated content\, then ask in advance in writing via MIO or Teams \(Include all teammates\)
    * If you decide to generate something and then edit it yourself significantly\, include the original generated content in an appendix for comparison purposes\.  Indicate that the content was generated but edited\.
    * All teammates should all agree on the team's use of generated content even if only some individuals use it\.
  * __Teacher reserves the right to assign marks only for content you created yourself if these privileges are abused\.  This may result in significantly low marks depending on the situation\.__
