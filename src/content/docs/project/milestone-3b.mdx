| Milestone 3b | Overview |
| --- | --- |

| Due: | Nov 17[^1] |
| Hand-in: | In class (short) presentation |
| Notes: | [Course late penalty](/about/syllabus) applies. |

In addition to a short progress update (like Milestone 3a), you will now begin creating defined releases for your project, as well as use GitHub actions to automate release management for future updates.

The exact instructions are in draft form, and should be updated in early November.

**Marking scheme**

In class, I will hand out self/peer assessments. On Nov 17[^1], teams will prepare (short, ~5min) presentations updating the class on their project so far.

[^1]: Date subject to change, keep up to date at https://www.jacfa.ca/

The scheme will be something like, out of 70 marks total:

- (10): Progress on defined requirements / updates to requirements
- (10): Quality of repository management / issue-tracking / progress documentation
- (10): Individual contribution to project
- (40): Some breakdown to do with implemented releases (correct semantic versioning, GitHub actions, peer-review)

I will also fill out these assements for everyone, and your final mark will be some combination self/peer/my evaluation.

## Tentative notes

The instructions below are in draft form, and should be updated in early November.

### Automating releases

When your initial implementation is ready, you will **publish your first release of the application**.

The following information will be helpful for this task:

- [GitHub Releases](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/about-releases)
- [git tags](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging)

For the version number, choose **v0.1.0**. Subsequent releases should be defined as follows (from [semvar.org](https://semver.org/)):
> Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:
> 
>   - MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes
>   - MINOR version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
>   - PATCH version when you make backward compatible bug fixes
> 
> Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.

You should aim to complete this initial release for the Sprint 2 deadline -- Oct 20. This release should be accompanied by a **release workflow** that produces an [Android App Bundle](https://developer.android.com/guide/app-bundle) using `gradlew`.

You can find tutorials which demonstrate this process online; here are some examples:
- https://github.com/marketplace/actions/build-android-app
