| Milestone 3b (Version 2) | Overview |
| --- | --- |
| Worth: | 7% |
| Due: | <strong>Nov 24</strong> |
| Hand-in: | In class (short) presentation |

In addition to a short progress update (like Milestone 3a), your app will now need to include advanced Navigation and State Management behavior learned in Assignment 3.

**Marking scheme (updates on Nov 15 marked in bold)**

In class, I will hand out self/peer assessments. On **Nov 24**, teams will prepare (short, 5-10min) presentations updating the class on their project so far.

**One new feature: I will ensure your up to date project code is pulled to the teaching computer in P322 -- a portion of your presentation should focus on exploring your source code and demonstrating that you have been meeting defined requirements**.

The grade you/your teammates is schemed out of 70 marks total:

- **(10): Participation in-class in all lectures (Nov 15 / 17 / 20) leading up to the milestone**
- (10): Progress on defined requirements / updates to requirements
- (10): Quality of repository management / issue-tracking / progress documentation
- (10): Individual contribution to project
- **(15):** Implementation of advanced Navigation in Compose for managing navigation in your application (see Assignment 3)
  - Expectations:
    - You should have a defined issue which tracks and shows the commits where these features were added that has been accepted by your team and pulled into your main branch.
    - You should be prepared to demonstrate your progress on this on Nov 17.
- **(15):** Implementation of state management (coroutines, landing screen, ViewModel) (see Assignment 3)
  - Expectations:
    - You should have a defined issue which tracks and shows the commits where these features were added that has been accepted by your team and pulled into your main branch.
    - You should be prepared to demonstrate your progress on this on Nov 17.
