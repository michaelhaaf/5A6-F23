| Milestone 3b (Version 2) | Overview |
| --- | --- |
| Worth: | 7% |
| Due: | Nov 17 |
| Hand-in: | In class (short) presentation |

In addition to a short progress update (like Milestone 3a), your app will now need to include advanced Navigation and State Management behavior learned in Assignment 3.

**Marking scheme**

In class, I will hand out self/peer assessments. On Nov 17, teams will prepare (short, ~5min) presentations updating the class on their project so far.

The scheme will be something like, out of 70 marks total:

- (10): Progress on defined requirements / updates to requirements
- (10): Quality of repository management / issue-tracking / progress documentation
- (10): Individual contribution to project
- (20): Implementation of advanced Navigation in Compose for managing navigation in your application (see Assignment 3)
  - Expectations:
    - You should have a defined issue which tracks and shows the commits where these features were added that has been accepted by your team and pulled into your main branch.
    - You should be prepared to demonstrate your progress on this on Nov 17.
- (20): Implementation of state management (coroutines, landing screen, ViewModel) (see Assignment 3)
  - Expectations:
    - You should have a defined issue which tracks and shows the commits where these features were added that has been accepted by your team and pulled into your main branch.
    - You should be prepared to demonstrate your progress on this on Nov 17.

I will also fill out these assements for everyone, and your final mark will be some combination self/peer/my evaluation.
