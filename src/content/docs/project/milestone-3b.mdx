| Milestone 3b (Version 2) | Overview |
| --- | --- |
| Worth: | 7% |
| Due: | Nov 17[^1] |
| Hand-in: | In class (short) presentation |
| Notes: | [Course late penalty](/about/syllabus) applies. |
</div>

In addition to a short progress update (like Milestone 3a), your app will now need to include advanced Navigation and State Management behavior learned in Assignment 3.

**Marking scheme**

In class, I will hand out self/peer assessments. On Nov 17[^1], teams will prepare (short, ~5min) presentations updating the class on their project so far.

[^1]: Date subject to change, keep up to date at https://www.jacfa.ca/

The scheme will be something like, out of 70 marks total:

- (10): Progress on defined requirements / updates to requirements
- (10): Quality of repository management / issue-tracking / progress documentation
- (10): Individual contribution to project
- (20): Implementation of advanced Navigation in Compose for managing navigation in your application (see Assignment 3)
- (20): Implementation of state management (coroutines, landing screen, ViewModel) (see Assignment 3)

I will also fill out these assements for everyone, and your final mark will be some combination self/peer/my evaluation.

## Tentative notes

The instructions below are in draft form, and should be updated in early November.

### Automating releases

When your initial implementation is ready, you will **publish your first release of the application**.

The following information will be helpful for this task:

- [GitHub Releases](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/about-releases)
- [git tags](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging)

For the version number, choose **v0.1.0**. Subsequent releases should be defined as follows (from [semvar.org](https://semver.org/)):
> Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:
> 
>   - MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes
>   - MINOR version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
>   - PATCH version when you make backward compatible bug fixes
> 
> Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.

You should aim to complete this initial release for the Sprint 2 deadline -- Oct 20. This release should be accompanied by a **release workflow** that produces an [Android App Bundle](https://developer.android.com/guide/app-bundle) using `gradlew`.

You can find tutorials which demonstrate this process online; here are some examples:
- https://github.com/marketplace/actions/build-android-app 
- https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/use-github-actions-to-automate-android-development/
