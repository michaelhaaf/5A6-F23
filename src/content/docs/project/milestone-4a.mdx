In addition to a short progress update (like Milestone 3a/3b), your app will now need to include Accessibility and Data storage features learned from the Assignment 4 codelabs.

Like Milestone 3b, a portion of your grade will be based on participation in lectures leading up to the Milestone (week of Nov 26-Dec 1).

Finally, you will be required to mark your first release of the application and have a complete GitHub Action workflow for generating a release of the application. Instructions for this portion of the milestone will be covered in class starting **Friday, Nov 17**. Lecture notes (to be finalized by Nov 17) will appear in [the software distribution & versioning lecture notes](/5A6-F23/lectures/development/05-software-distribution) and [CI/CD with Github for Android lecture notes](/5A6-F23/lectures/developement/03-ci-cd).

## Marking scheme

In class, I will hand out self/peer assessments. On **Dec 1**, teams will prepare (short, ~5min) presentations updating the class on their project so far.

The grade you/your teammates receive is schemed out of 70 marks total:

- (10): Participation in-class in all lectures (Nov 24 / 27 / 29) leading up to the milestone**
- (10): Progress on defined requirements / updates to requirements
- (10): Quality of repository management / issue-tracking / progress documentation
- (10): Individual contribution to project
- (10): Implementation of Accessibility best practises for Android in Compose for your application (see Assignment 4)
  - Expectations:
    - You should have a defined issue which tracks and shows the commits where these features were added that has been accepted by your team and pulled into your main branch.
    - You should be prepared to demonstrate your progress on this on Dec 1.
- (10): Implementation of Android Datastore for your application (see Assignment 4)
  - Expectations:
    - You should have a defined issue which tracks and shows the commits where these features were added that has been accepted by your team and pulled into your main branch.
    - You should be prepared to demonstrate your progress on this on Dec 1.
- (10): GitHub CI/CD for Android: publishing a versioned release that automatically updates when `main` branch is updated.
