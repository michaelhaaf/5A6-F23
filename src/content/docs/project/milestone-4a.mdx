## Tentative instructions

The instructions below are in draft form, and should be updated in early November.

### Automating releases

When your initial implementation is ready, you will **publish your first release of the application**.

The following information will be helpful for this task:

- [GitHub Releases](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/about-releases)
- [git tags](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging)

For the version number, choose **v0.1.0**. Subsequent releases should be defined as follows (from [semvar.org](https://semver.org/)):
> Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:
> 
>   - MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes
>   - MINOR version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
>   - PATCH version when you make backward compatible bug fixes
> 
> Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.

You should aim to complete this initial release for the Sprint 2 deadline -- Oct 20. This release should be accompanied by a **release workflow** that produces an [Android App Bundle](https://developer.android.com/guide/app-bundle) using `gradlew`.

You can find tutorials which demonstrate this process online; here are some examples:
- https://github.com/marketplace/actions/build-android-app 
- https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/use-github-actions-to-automate-android-development/
- https://blog.logrocket.com/android-ci-cd-using-github-actions/
