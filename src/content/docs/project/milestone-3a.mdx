| Milestone 3 | Overview |
| --- | --- |
| Worth: | 3% |
| Due: | Nov 3 |
| Hand-in: | In-class (short) presentation |
| Notes: | [Course late penalty](/about/syllabus) applies. |
</div>

As we already have links to your repository, there will be no discrete hand-in for this. The goal: make concrete progress on your project according to the proposals you created on GitHub, and give/get feedback on what you've found difficult/easy/worthwhile so far to share with other groups. 

The presentation should not require preparation/slides/etc., it's more informal this time. That said, you should try to have made some progress on your project to share!

**Marking scheme**

In class, I will hand out self/peer assessments. On Nov 3, teams will prepare (short, ~5min) presentations updating the class on their project so far.

The scheme will be something like, out of 30 marks total:

- (10): Progress on defined requirements from Milestone 2b / updates to requirements
- (10): Quality of repository management / issue-tracking / progress documentation
- (10): Individual contribution to project

I will also fill out these assements for everyone, and your final mark will be some combination self/peer/my evaluation.
