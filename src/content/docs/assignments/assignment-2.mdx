For this assignment, you will create a single screen mobile app that runs on an emulated Android, interacts with the user, and uses state.

The topic of the app is of your choice.
- Recommendation: Choose a screen/subject that may align with your eventual project.  Try to focus on something different than your teammates.

This is an individual assignment. You may assist other classmates but:

> Your submitted work must be clear, complete, and YOUR OWN. You must be prepared to explain any part of your work to me in person. Failure to do so can/will void any grade you get on this assignment.

## Prequisites

- This assignment will assume you've been following along with the Kotlin content we've covered so far in this course. Check the [course calendar](/5A6-F23/about/calendar) to review exercises/lectures/examples we have covered so far. Aim to improve your style and clarity in this new programming language with each assignment.
- The [Jetpack Compose codelabs](https://developer.android.com/courses/pathways/jetpack-compose-for-android-developers-1) we have been covering in class will be directly helpful for this assignment -- you're basically taking what you've learned from these, and making your own version of it.

## Requirements

### Code

  - Programmed in Kotlin, using Jetpack Compose for UI
  - Use Material design for theming
  - Contain multiple components and show good attention to layout
  - Show reasonable attention to styling/theming
  - Get user input (button and/or text input)
  - Update what is on the screen based on user input (using mutableState)
  - Display at least one list of information that the user has entered
  - Be robust to rotating the device
  - The code must compile and run.
    - If you submit something with compile errors or that shows no meaningful output, a high penalty will be assessed, as appropriate.
  - Usable interface: understandable layout, clear wording/instructions

### Documentation

  - In your code, follow the [Kotlin Docs "Documentation comments"](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html#documentation-comments) guide. Your functions and classes should have a brief comment above them in this style. I mean **brief**: some people like comments for their own sake; I am of the opinion that code should be self-documenting. Aim to write clear code and keep comments to a minimum.
  - Any code you adapt/use/modify/copy-directly from another source **MUST** have a comment providing the URL, date of retrieval, and a brief explanation of how the code is used/modified. [See the first three sections of this link](https://integrity.mit.edu/handbook/writing-code) for clarification.
    - That rule should cover pretty much any case you can think of (the KotlinDocs, help from a classmate, random internet sources, ChatGPT, etc.) -- you are allowed to use any of these things PROVIDED you follow the rule about citing your source/explaining your usage of the code.
  - the README.md or README.txt included at the root level of your app
    - The Readme should give a high-level indication of what the app is and how to use it. If there are any known issues, they should be described/explained in the Readme.

### Deliverable

- The `.zip` that you hand-in to Moodle should contain:
  - One or more `.kt` (Kotlin) files containing your source code and your runtime environment
    - Whether your source code contains one `main.kt` file containing all of your source code, or several `.kt` files separating the logic of your source code, is entirely up to you.
  - A README.md or README.txt (NOT .docx, .pdf, or any other format) at the rool level of your project
  - DO NOT INCLUDE any other files (`.jar`, gradle files, github files, etc. etc.) -- I only need your source code and your README, i.e. the files that you have written yourself.


## Marking Scheme

- 80% [functionality](#code) 
- 20% [documentation](#documentation)
