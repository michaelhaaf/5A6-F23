## Assignment #1: Single screen Kotlin Multiplatform / Compose Multiplatform App

* Worth 5% of grade\.  Due Apr 11 by 4:00pm\.  This is an individual assignment\.
* For this assignment\, you will create a single screen mobile app that runs on one platform \(iOS or Android\)\, and uses the multiplatform technologies taught in class\.
* The topic of the app is of your choice
  * Recommendation: Choose a screen/subject that aligns with your project\.  Try to focus on something different than your teammates\.
* The app must:
  * Be based on the Compose Multiplatform template and programmed in Kotlin
  * Use Material design
  * Contain multiple components and show good attention to layout
  * Show reasonable attention to styling/theming
  * Get user input \(button and/or text input\)
  * Update what is on the screen based on user input \(using mutableState\)
* The code must be documentation internally and contain a Readme file
  * The internal documentation should be informative and meaningful \(i\.e\.\, not vacuous\)
  * The Readme should give a high level indication of what the product is and how to use it\.  If there are any known issues\, they should be described/explained in the Readme\.  The Readme file should live at the root level of the project\.
* The code must compile and run\.
  * If you submit something with compile errors or that shows no meaningful output\, a high penalty will be assessed\, as appropriate\.
* The app should be usable â€“ with clear wording/instructions and understandable\, easy\-to\-use interface

* Marking Scheme:
  * 40% Functionality
  * 20% Styling/Layout
  * 20% Documentation
  * 20% Usability/Design
  * 10% Bonus: Works on both iOS and Android\!
* Submission:
  * Submit zip file of entire project on Lea\.
* Late Penalty:
  * Late submissions lose 10% per day to a maximum of 1 day \(specifically: midnight the next day\)
  * Nothing accepted after 1 day without prior arrangement and a grade of zero may be given\.
  * Strong Recommendation: Submit incomplete version ON TIME with explanation of what is not done\.  Submit completed version the next day\.  This will likely result in a lower penalty than just submitting late\.
* Original work\!
  * "Your submitted work must be clear\, complete\, and YOUR OWN\.  You must be prepared to explain any of your work to me in person\.  Failure to be able to defend your work\, or do a similar question in front of me in person can/will void any grade you get on this assignment\."
  * Any code snippets copied or highly inspired from a 3rd party source must be explicitly indicated in the code documentation or Readme\.  The total amount of such non\-original code should be a small portion of your code\.
