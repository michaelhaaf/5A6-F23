This assignment will be very similar to [Assignment 3](#prev): you will complete some codelabs and commit your progress as you go.

This time, you will choose **two** of the following codelabs to complete. You should choose different (Optional) codelabs than your project teammates.

- (Required): TBD
- (Optional): TBD
- (Optional): TBD
- (Optional): TBD

The actual coding part of this assignment is explained in each codelab, so there are no other instructions as such. The git and Github skills required for this lab are the same as [Assignment 3](#prev), and are documented in more detail in the [git][git-notes] and [advanced git][git-adv-notes] lectures.

## Goals

1. Build on Jetpack Compose / Android development knowledge
2. Practise git/GitHub skills

## Requirements

Your submission will be a **private** GitHub repository, with @michaelhaaf invited as a collaborator, called **Assignment 4** (or similar, the name isn't that important). The rest of the requirements in the marking scheme below are things that should be in that repository by the deadline.

**Tentative Marking Scheme**

The exact weights may change slightly, but should serve as a guide for the rough proportions for each part of the assignment.

- (4) A main branch containing your initial code (the two codelab starting points)
- (30) A development branch for each codelab tracking your progress through that codelab
- (36) An open pull request from each development branch to `main`

There are a total of 70 marks available. The rubric details for each requirement follow in the sections below.

### (4) Main branch requirements

[gitignore]: https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Android.gitignore

- (1) Repository requirements met (private, @michaelhaaf collaborator, begins as bare repository with only default Initial commit)
- (1) [Android template `.gitignore`][gitignore], either included in Initial commit, or added in a subsequent commit immediately after. **Don't forget this step** -- your subsequent commits will be affected by the presence of this file in an important way.
- (2) Initial commits representing the addition of whatever relevant starter code is necessary for your codelabs

Suggestion: This repo should begin as a **bare repository** with nothing and only yourself and me (@michaelhaaf) as collaborators. Do not fork another branch to begin this repository. See [Getting Started](#getting-started) for more details, whether you are starting from scratch or you have progress from the previous version of this assignment you want to adapt.

### (30) Development branch requirements

The following requirements apply to both development branches (15 marks for each codelab)

- (5) Marks for progress on the codelab itself
  - If you finish the whole codelab, you get full marks -- partial marks for partial progress.
  - Feel free to make use of the guided solutions provided in the tutorial -- **make sure you try the steps yourself and understand the accompanying tutorial**. Most of the marks are for your commit messages explaining the changes made, as you'll see below. 
- (10) Marks for quality of commit messages tracking your progress
  - Your commit history should document each **functional change** required by the labs into **separate commits**.
  - **Commit messages** should demonstrate best practises outlined in the [git/github lecture notes][git-notes].

NOTE: The idea isn't to get it perfect the first time! One of the goals of this lab is to practise [Tailoring commit history][tailoring-commit-history] so that you can [Update Pull Requests][update-pull-requests] with confidence (links go to relevant lecture notes). That is, learning how to use `git` to rewrite/tweak/edit/squash/create local branch commits before pushing/updating a pull request.

### (36) Pull request requirements

[template-nav]: https://github.com/michaelhaaf/5A6-F23-assignment3/pull/1#issue-1958579519
[template-state]: https://github.com/michaelhaaf/5A6-F23-assignment3/pull/2#issue-1958594678
[template-pr]: https://github.com/michaelhaaf/5A6-F23-assignment4/blob/main/.github/pull_request_template.md

The following requirements apply to both development branches (18 marks for each codelab)

- (8) Marks for pull request management
  - should be a linear set of commits from the appropriate branch
  - updates to the pull request done directly, rather than creating new pull requests
  - pull request template used for entering codelab progress / answering codelab questions. This should be pushed to main branch after the previous initial commits. [Link to sample template from Assignment 4][template-pr]
- (10) Marks for progress on codelab documented/answers to questions about each codelab. These are included in the pull request template I linked above.

The questions are short and aren't intended to take you too much time -- they are there simply to make sure you noticed/understood some foundational concepts from each codelab.

The Pull Request template you are using/adapting is explained in more detail in the [Creating a Pull Request template][creating-a-pull-request-template] section.

## Tips

The tips provide below aren't comprehensive (e.g. there's no step-by-step instructions for creating the repository) or all strictly necessary (i.e. there's more than one way to meet the requirements of the assignment stated above) but should serve as a useful guideline for the main tasks.
