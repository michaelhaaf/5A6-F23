For this assignment, you practise intermediate Jetpack Compose techniques from the Android compose labs.

You will also complete a series of exercises in git/GitHub at the same time.

This will start due to the fact that **each codelab** requires you to *clone* an existing repository and to build on top of it.

In this assignment, you will use [git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) to track your changes to each codelab as you make progress.

## Goals

1. Build on Jetpack Compose knowledge
  - Learn Navigation
  - Learn the View Model and Android App Architecture

2. Practise git/GitHub skills

## Tasks

1. Create a new, **private** GitHub repository called **Assignment 3**. This should be a **bare repository** with nothing in it. See [here]() for example instructions.

1. Both the [Navigation][navigation-codelab] and [Advanced State][adv-state-codelab] are derived from the same repository: [android codelabs](https://github.com/android/codelab-android-compose.git). We will **add this repository to your Assignment 3 repository as a submodule**.

```bash title="/path/to/your/repo/Assignment 3/
$ git submodule add https://github.com/android/codelab-android-compose
```

:::Tip
The compose-codelab repository is a **monorepository** -- that is, a repository that contains multiple independent projects in separate directories. This lab requires you to interact with just two of those projects -- the **NavigationCodelab** and the **AdvancedStateAndSideEffectsCodelab**.

To use independent projects in Android Studio correctly, make sure that you open the project at the **project root**, that is, the directory which contains all of the project files. E.g., for the **NavigationCodelab**, the project root is the **NavigationCodelab** directory.
:::

Adding an external repository as a submodule is a convenient way to separately track changes to repositories you don't own, but nevertheless interact with directly in your own work.

1. Complete the [Navigation codelab][navigation-codelab]

Follow the steps in the Navigation codelab. Aside from the instructions given in the codelab itself, there are some additional requirements I will ask you to complete below.

  - In your **Assignment 3** repository, create a new branch: `navigation-codelab`.

Create a separate commit for each step in the code lab. Your commit message should summarize the changes made in that codelab step.

- If you have already completed parts of this codelab from before, you can import all of your changes at once in one commit.

1. Complete the [Advanced state and side effects][adv-state-codelab]

  - In your **Assignment 3** repository, create a new branch: `advanced-state-codelab`.

  - The commit instructions are the same for this codelab as the previous codelab.


1. Add myself (`@michaelhaaf`) as a collaborator to your repository

## Requirements

TBD, but the basic rubric will be:

- Repository and submodule set up complete
- Codelab progress -- complete both codelabs for full marks in this section, partial marks for partial progress.
- Commit messages for each step, explaining all changes made and why.
