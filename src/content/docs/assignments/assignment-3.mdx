For this assignment, you practise intermediate Jetpack Compose techniques from the Android compose labs.

You will also complete in git/GitHub at the same time.

This will start due to the fact that **each codelab** requires you to *clone* an existing repository and to build on top of it.

In this assignment, you will use [git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) to track your changes to each codelab as you make progress.



## Goals

1. Build on Jetpack Compose knowledge
  - Learn Navigation
  - Learn the View Model and Android App Architecture

2. Practise git/GitHub skills

## Tasks

0. Create a new, **private** GitHub repository called **Assignment 3**. This should be a **bare repository** with nothing in it. See [here]() for example instructions.

1. Complete the [Navigation codelab][navigation-codelab]
  - Create a separate commit for each step in the code lab. Your commit message should summarize the changes made in that codelab step.
  - If you have already completed parts of this codelab from before, you can import all of your changes at once in one commit.
2. Complete the [Advanced state and side effects][adv-state-codelab]
  - The commit instructions are the same for this codelab as the previous codelab.


## Requirements

TBD, but the basic rubric will be:

- Repository and submodule set up complete
- Codelab progress -- complete both codelabs for full marks in this section, partial marks for partial progress.
- Commit messages for each step, explaining all changes made and why.
