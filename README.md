# Application Development II course repository

This repository contains the source code and contents for the Fall 2023 offering of 420-5A6: Application Development II at John Abbott College.

## ðŸš€ Site structure

This project is built using a modification of the [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/) theme from the [Astro](https://astro.build/) static site generation framework.

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ docs/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ config.ts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ env.d.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Starlight looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory. Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Images can be added to `src/assets/` and embedded in Markdown with a relative link.

Static assets, like favicons, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
